== Motivation

[quote,H.G. Wells 1945]
____
Adapt or perish, now as ever, is Nature's inexorable imperative.
____

* Experiment with Domain Driven Design
* Write a business application
* Have a teaching and experiment application written in Modern Java

[.notes]
--
* Experiment with modern Java: record, sealed types, stream, functional Programming
* Write a small and useful ERP
* Experiment with digital transformation
* Concrete example for teaching
--

== Explorations

* Domain Driven Design Architecture
* Modern Java functional programming _lambda, streams, algebraic data types_
* Java User Interface _Vaadin PWA and mobile first_
* Java Persistance _MicroStreams_

== Domain Driven Design

* Key interfaces and classes to define bounded domains
* Use to create bounded domain user interfaces
* Administrative features are available to monitor a bounded domain

== Modern Java

* Current JDK Version _JDK 15_ and _JDK 16_
* Functional Programming Approaches
* Good Practices

== https://vaadin.com/[Vaadin]

* Pure Java approach to write the PWA mobile first user interface
* Support of TypeScript and https://lit-html.polymer-project.org/[lit-html] for special needs

== https://microstream.one/[MicroStream]

* Incredible Efficient Approach to persist models
* Persistent Store per Bounded Domain support DDD
* Lessons Learnt
** Eager Save to store an entity
** Application is responsible to manage object identitfiers

== Key Framework Ideas

Mixins:: defines key abstractions in business domains
Labels or Tags:: defines a user controlled ontology and be processed
Table Codes:: defines a domain controlled and processed ontology
Comments:: Human readable information as free form structure
