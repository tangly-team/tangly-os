/**
 * <p>The package defines dynamic enumeration values representing a code table and provides strong typing in the business models using them. Code
 * instances are immutable.</p>
 * <p>Codes are a Java abstraction to represent code tables. Code tables are dynamic enumeration values which can be stored in an external resource
 * file in a database. Mechanisms are provided to extend Java enumeration types to emulate code tables. Therefore you can start developing using enumeration
 * values and later migrate to extensible typed value sets.</p>
