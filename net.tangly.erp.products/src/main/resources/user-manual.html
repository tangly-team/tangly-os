<h1>User Manual</h1>
<h2>Concepts</h2>
<p>The bounded domain <em>products</em> abstracts the work activities on ordered projects to develop a digital product.</p>
<dl>
    <dt>Product</dt>
    <dd>A digital product realized through a set of work contracts.</dd>
    <dt>Work Contact</dt>
    <dd>A work contract has a budget of hours to work on the product. The work contract can be an extension of a main contract.
        A work contract has a time range.
    </dd>
    <dt>Assignment</dt>
    <dd>A collaborator can work for a work contract during a time range. The collaborator reports work efforts associated to the assignement.
        The assignment has a time range. The collaborator and the organization can set the closing date on the assignment to indicate that all activities until
        the closing date have been reported in the system.
    </dd>
    <dt>Collaborator</dt>
    <dd>A collaborator working on the development of the digital products through a set of assignements. Work is reporting in efforts.</dd>
    <dt>Efforts</dt>
    <dd>A collaborator work is described in an effort. An effort has a date when the work was done and a duration. An effort is connected to an assignment
        and a work contract. A summary of activities performed during the effort is described in a text field. If relevant details can be added to the
        minutes' field.
    </dd>
</dl>
<h2>Workflows</h2>
<h3>Record Efforts</h3>
<p>The collaborator can input the details of each effort into the system through the user interface.</p>
<p>Effort for an assignment shall be reported daily. If multiple work contracts are used, they are reported through different efforts.
    <em>This situation is either if different roles and tariffs are used, or the older contract has reached its end and the collaborator starts working on
        on a contract extension.</em></p>
<h3>Import Efforts</h3>
<p>The collaborator can document her activities in an effort report offline using an YAML format.
    The collaborator can be imported the files into the system when the collaborator when she is ready.
    <em>The import process allows the collaborator to import only new efforts or to overwrite older versions with the current file.
        Efforts can be only overwriten if they are not in the closing period.</em></p>
<h3>Create Effort Report</h3>
<p>Employeess can create an effort report describing the activities a collaborator performed in an assignment during a selected time range.
    The report contains the description, worked time, and minutes. The total of worked time per contract and for the whole assignement are provided.</p>
<p>The report is a PDF document, which can be sent to customers to document the work done.</p>
<h2>Reporting</h2>
<h2>Connection to Invoicing</h2>
<h2>Managemeent Processes</h2>
<p>The responsible person shall create the necessary assignments in the system. The assignements specify who can work on which product during a specific time
    range.</p>
<p>The work contract is automatically generated when a contract is signed. The bounded domain <em>customers</em> sends the event <em>ContractSignedEvent</em>
    upon successful contract negociation.</p>
