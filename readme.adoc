The *primary repository* is hosted under GitHub https://github.com/marcelbaumann/tangly-os.git[tangly OS GitHub].

A mirror is also hosted under GitLab https://gitlab.com/marcelbaumann/tangly-os[tangly OS GitLab].
A legacy mirror is also hosted under BitBucket https://bitbucket.org/tangly-team/tangly-os.git[tangly OS BitBucket].

The issue tracker for errors, improvements, and corrections is https://bitbucket.org/tangly-team/tangly-os/issues[tangly OS issues].

For any further questions, you can use the forum https://github.com/orgs/tangly-team/discussions[tangly-Discussions].

We are experimenting with the most current versions of components, libraries and JDK.
The components are stored in a single git repository and are build using a multi-modules gradle build script.

== Contribution

You are welcome to contribute to the product with pull requests on Bitbucket.
You can download the source files from the https://bitbucket.org/tangly-team/tangly-os.git[bitbucket git repository].
Build the library with the provided gradle configuration file.

== Compile the product

You shall have access to a https://git-scm.com/[Git] installation to clone the repository and download the files.
You must install https://openjdk.java.net/install/index.html[JDK] version 15 to compile the source code.
The https://gradle.org/[Gradle] build file can be triggered without any supplemental installation with

[source,shell]
----
./gradlew build
----

The first run will take time because all dependencies will be downloaded from Maven repositories.
The next compilations will be much faster.
Ensure you have enough bandwidth to provide a smooth experience.

All development activities are performed with probably the best Java IDE IntelliJ IDEA.

== DevOps Activities

These instructions are for project committers.

The project is hosted on:

[source, bash]
----
git add remote origin-github      git@github.com:tangly-team/tangly-os.git                <1>
