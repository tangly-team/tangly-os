|ID |Description

|CRM-001 |As a salesperson I want to create and modify a legal entity so that I have a record of every organization my company is working with.
I want to have access to data describing the organization so that I can formally interact with them.

|CRM-002 |As a salesperson I want to create and modify a natural entity so that I have a record of every prospect my company interacts with.
I want to have access to data describing the person so that I can better interact with her.

|CRM-003 |As a salesperson I want to define when a person is working for an organization so that I have an history of which companies a contact worked for.
We register the duration when a person is an employee of an organization.
A person can work for multiple organizations simultaneously.

|CRM-004 |As an employee I want to create and modify an interaction describing how I interact with a legal entity so that an history of all initiatives exists.
The goal of an interaction is to conclude a contract.

|CRM-005 |As an employee I want to document all activities with entities necessary during an interaction so that an history of all communicaitons exists

|CRM-006 |As a salesperson I want to register all legal contracts with an organization so taht I have a trace of these legal documens.

|CRM-007 |As a salesperson I want to initiate an interaction with a legal entity and actively work to conclude a contract with them.
I can have multiple activities to interact with the organization before concluding the interaction.
An interaction can be completed successfully or not.
During the timeline of the interaction the potential and probability of success can change.
As a salesperson I am only interested on the current potential and success odds and not on their timely evolution.

|===

A legal and natural entity shall provide links to gather additional information.
A standard approach is to provide a link to the organization or persson LinkedIn profile.

All entities support tags and comments to add additional information or define orthogonal classifiations.

The following secondary workflows are under evaluation

. As a salesperson I want to create a lead so that A list of potential prospects is available.
. As a salesperson I want to promote a lead to a legal entity so that I can perform sales activities with this organization.

The non-functional constraints for typical regular small and medium enterprise datasets.

. The legal entities are less than 5'000 organizations.
. The natural entities are less than 20'000 persons.
. The contract entities are less than 5'000 a year with a legal retention of the year.
The total number is less than 50'000.
. The active employees of the company are less than 200.

==== Shared Features

The bounded domain uses the features provided through the tangly-os shared kernel.

All entities can have human-readable comments and orthogonal tags.
Comments provide a mechanism to add unstructured human-readable information.
Tags allow the definition of classification and informal ontologies.
