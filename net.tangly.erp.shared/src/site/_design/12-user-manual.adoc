== User Manual

=== Idea

The tangly services ERP provides the functionalities to manage service company offerings and legal documents.

The first customer ever using the application is https://www.tangly.net[tangly llc] company.
The company is an agile consulting and Java stack boutique organization.

A service company has no inventory, production, or logistics departments.

A service company has a strong focus on customers, digital products, projects and associated efforts.
Cash flow is dictated by the timely invoicing of performed activities.
The cash drain is mainly salaries and social costs.

The application follows the principles of {ref-naked-objects} to provide a user interface

Business entities are displayed in a grid.
CRUD operations are available for each entity.
Context menus provide access to business operations.

== Common Concepts

The import of data is a common operation for each bounded domain.
All available data will be imported.
Overwriting existing data is disabled.

Bounded domains are independent of each other.
The order of import is not relevant.
Each bounded domain has its own import operation and is responsible for the ordering of the associated import operations.

== Products

=== Effort Tracking Workflow

Collaborators can be assigned to products.
An assignement connects a collaborator to a product, a time interval and a contract.
They document their activities in time sheets describing the performed efforts.

Efforts are written down in a YAML file for each day, and each assignment.
The assignment uniquely identifies the product and the collaborator.
NO more than one effort shall be recorded per day and per assignment.

=== Effort Files

Efforts can be documented in YAML files.

The human-readable identifier shall be unique.
Each contract is associated with a digital product development.
