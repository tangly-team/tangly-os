=== Context

image::OS-005-head.png[width=420,height=360,role=left]
The {ref-tangly} open source libraries are mature enough to be used in public commercial and academic projects.

The libraries were used in internal projects and  refined to  fulfill these requirements.
More customers will validate the usefulness of the library and identify extensions for further releases.

We want to provide a standard and well-known approach for our customers.
They shall have access to our libraries through official and well-documented channels.

=== Decision

The libraries shall be published as artifacts on maven central and be accessible to a wide range of developers and organizations.
A website shall be set up to provide an adequate documentation for users.

The https://blog.tangly.net[Technical Documentation] will use a static web approach to minimize costs and provide good legibility.
All open source components will be hosted on the same site.

The libraries will be published on Maven Central to maximize potential usage.

=== Consequences

* We have to establish a publishing process at the company level to deploy signed artifacts to maven central repository.
See link:../../../../../../ideas/components-publication[release and publication process].
* We have to establish a public website to host the documentation of public-published libraries.
 The static website is {ref-site}
* We have to support semantic versioning for all future releases of public-published libraries.
