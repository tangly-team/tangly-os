The application is an application of modern software engineering principles.

The essential features are used to implement all acquisition, project management and financial process of an agile software consulting company.

The smoke test is to run the {ref-tangly} processes on the ERP solution.

|doc-001|Correct|Documentation needs to be accurate and free from errors. Wrong documentation is often worse than no documentation.
|doc-002|Current|Documentation needs to be correct over time, reflecting changes performed upon code, infrastructure or interfaces of the system.
|doc-003|Understandable|Documentation needs to be understood by the target audience.
|doc-004|Relevant|With respect to structure, form and content, documentation shall be relevant for the tasks of its audience.
|doc-005|Referenceable|Use a consistent numbering schema for headings, diagrams and tables.
|doc-006|Proper language|Use proper language, correct spelling and grammar, active voice, positive statements and short sentences.
|doc-007|Maintainable|Maintainability is key to keeping documentation current.
|doc-008|Easy to find|Documentation itself should be easy to find whenever needed. Its content should be easily navigable and searchable.
|doc-009|Versioned|As the system evolves, so will your documentation, without losing its history
|doc-010|Tooling support|Focus on content, reduce time needed for tool-setup
|doc-011|Continuously updated|Make it a habit to maintain and expand the documentation with every relevant change in your system.
|doc-012|Relevant|Documentation should be written in a public domain format. Multiple public tools should support writing in the selected format.
|doc-013|Relevant|Documentation should be searchable to easily access topics.
|===

The current approach is {ref-arc42} structure, {ref-c4} and {ref-uml} diagrams to document the design.
The content is written in {ref-asciidoc} format.
The documentation is published as a static website using {ref-hugo} and {ref-docsy}.

The Java source code is documented with Javadoc.
Source code in other programming languages is documented with {ref-doxygen}.
