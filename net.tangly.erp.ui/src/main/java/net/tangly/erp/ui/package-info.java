/**
 * The main view shall support the domain driven design approach of bounded domains. At the same time the naked object approach for domain entities shall also
 * be part of the solution space.
 * <p>Each bounded domain shall be accessible through a router link on the left drawer. All naked entities are accessble through a bounded domain specific
 * menu list. The menu list consists again of router links. Therefore we have navigation URL for all bounded domains and exported entities.</p>
 * <p>The AppLayout and RouterLink abstractions of vaadin cleanly support the chosen approach.</p>
