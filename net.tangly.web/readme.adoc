== Purpose

The *tangly web* component provides a Vaadin based user interfaces for enterprise applications written in Java.
The component is using records and requires *Java 17 or higher*.

Currently, we are moving at the bleeding edge of our components.
Therefore to build and execute the ERP application please

[source,shell]
----
    mvn jetty:run
----

The initial username and password are 'administrator' and 'aeon'.

The file _application.properties_ in _â€¦/main/resources_ directory tailors the configuration of the application, mainly the location of data.
The file contains comments for new users.

The Maven POM file is used to build the application and run it because the Gradle Jetty plugin crashes.
