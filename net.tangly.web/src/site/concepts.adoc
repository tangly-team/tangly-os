- Item Property Value ->
Item has one (Concept) Type, Property has a PropertyType, PropertyType validate PropertyValue
-> a Property is mandatory or optional, 0..1, 1..1, 0..n, 1..n
-> Code, Tags, Comments

=== Ideas

Experiment with the cluster Class with properties, relations, codes, tags and comments.
The cluster can be mapped to a structural ontology.
Object diagrams can be mapped to RDF ternary terms.

Items are uniquely identified through their external identity.
Values have no identifiers.
