# Purpose

The test results technical module uses the new aggregate test reporting concept of Gradle.

Plugins aggregate test results from all subprojects and generate a single report.

# Commands

The set of Gradle command line special commands we seldom use:

* To generate aggregated test report           `gradle testAggregateTestReport`
* To generate aggregated test coverage report  `gradle testCodeCoverageReport`
