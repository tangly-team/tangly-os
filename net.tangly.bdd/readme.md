## Purpose

A behavior driven development library that provides a custom extension based on the JUnit 5 Jupiter Extension Model.
This library can be used to create and run stories and behaviors as BDD specification tests.

The library is a developer-first approach. Developers write acceptance tests to validate the functions they have implemented. The generated
report provides a living documentation of the features and allows customers to validate the acceptance criteria.

The library is compact and integrated with JUnit 5 without disrupting TDD approaches and continuous integration pipelines.

## Download and Documentation

You need to add JUnit 5 dependencies before using this library. If you are using Maven or Gradle, add the following dependency after declaring the
 JUnit 5 dependency. We recommend using __assertJ__ assertion library to write more legible conditions.

The library can be included in Maven as

```xml
    <dependency>
      <groupId>net.tangly</groupId>
      <artifactId>bdd</artifactId>
      <version>0.2.7</version>
    </dependency>
```

The library can be included in Gradle as

```groovy
    testImplementation "net.tangly:bdd:0.2.7"
```

The documentation can be found under [BDD documentation](https://tangly-team.bitbucket.io/docs/bdd/)
