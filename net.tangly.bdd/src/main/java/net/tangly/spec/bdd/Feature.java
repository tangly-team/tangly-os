 * A feature or a story describes the behavior of the build system. You can use a story template or free text to describe the behavior of the system. For each feature, a set of
 * scenarios or tests are defined in the form "Given a context When a specific event happens, then the expected outcomes are as described". The "Given When Then" scenarios are
 * described in unit tests using the features of JUnit 5 such as test class and nested classes to document and implement the "Given When" and test methods to realize the "Then"
 * part. The display name annotation is used to produce readable and executable behavior-driven tests.
