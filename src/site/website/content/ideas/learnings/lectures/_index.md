## Software Architecture and Techniques Lectures

[Software Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_architecture) and Techniques *SWAT* discuss approaches, methods and tools taught in the context
of agile development approaches. It reflects current trends where more than 80 % of new software development is performed using
[agile software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) approaches.

The depth of the concepts shall be modulated to the knowledge of the participants. Primary goals are to establish comprehension on agile architecture and master
a small set of techniques enabling the participant to define a component or a small application architecture.

## Modern Java and Selected JVM Languages Lectures

Modern Java and Selected JVM languages *PCP* discuss programming paradigms to write legible, efficient source code.
Theory is mapped to programming language features.
The participants learn how to create modern design concepts and implement them in JVM languages such as Java, Clojure, and Groovy.

Key themes are:

- [Algebraic data types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_data_type) with records, sealed types and libraries such as lombok
- [Functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) with lambdas, streams, and optional. Functional concepts of first-class
  citizens, currying, recursion are discussed.
- [Pattern matching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_matching) extensions in switch, if and instanceof expressions.
- Module concept in Java environment
- Advanced concepts such as [Valhalla](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/valhalla/), [Loom](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/loom/),
  [Panama](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/panama/), and [Amber](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/amber/) and their impact on JVM programming
- [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) and [Groovy](https://groovy-lang.org/) are extensively used to explain better implementations of the above concepts.
