The logging library https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SLF4J[slf4j] seems to be a dead project for at least one year.
The last commit in the https://github.com/qos-ch/slf4j[GitHub slf4j repository] was performed two years ago.
Version 2.0 of the library is an alpha release on https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.slf4j/slf4j-api[Maven Central] dating back to October 2019.

The apache project log4j has made tremendous progress with the creation of the log4j2 library.
All features provided in slf4j are now available in log4j2.
In particular, the fluent interface which is only available in the beta version of slf4j is also supported.
Additional features are also provided and performance is better than with other logging frameworks.

The project is active and under the umbrella of the https://www.apache.org[Apache Foundation].
The library uses well-documented Java module names as any modern library shall provide.

This situation raises the question to move our application to the apache logging framework.
Both APIs are very similar in style and naming.
the effort to migrate is quite reasonable.
Usually, only the logger declaration needs a modification.
The creation of logging records uses exactly the same syntax and calling conventions.

The advantage is better integration with an actively supported and developed library.

=== Decision

All components will be migrated to the log4j2 library
footnote:[It is sad that such a well-crafted library as slf4j is fading away.
We assume that the community actively working on extensions was too small.
Ceki Gülcü did a wonderful job to pave the way for modern and efficient logging concepts in the Java world.].

All components shall use the fluent interface to write logging records.
This decision shall increase the legibility of the source code.

Staying in a library no more under active development is too dangerous.
Closing of security issues and support of current JDK versions are not guaranteed.

=== Consequences

* All source files must be modified to use the new library
** All logging record creations shall use a fluent interface.
As in slf4j, no string concatenation shall happen in log record calls, use the message feature of the library.
** Logging level is specified by using the fluent interface
** No conditional statements shall be used to bracket logging statements
** Exceptions are always stated through the fluent user interface and are not an argument of the log message
* All https://gradle.org/[Gradle] build files shall use the new library.
The API is declared as an implementation dependency.
The core library is declared as a test or runtime dependency.
* Testing shall be performed to verify correct behavior and correct configuration.

We shall explore if trouble arise from used components which are using other logging libraries.
The risk is small because it is already existing wehn using slf4j liberary.
The difference is only our new preferred library is now the Apache one.

The architecture of log4j2 is described in https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/architecture.html[Log4j2 Main Components].

=== Learnings

* The log4j2 community reacted professionally and fast in 2022 to correct a security attack in the library.
The update of all libraries and applications with the patched version was done in a few minutes.
A gradle plugin was used to infer which version of the library was used.
The continuous implementation and delivery pipeline were used to generate hardened versions.
* A new feature of Gradle supports the definition of dependencies in a central file for all submodules.
The project uses _libs.version.toml_ configuration file to unify library usage through all components.
