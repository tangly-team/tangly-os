== OS-002 Define Unit Test Conventions

Date: 2020-06-15

=== Status

Implemented

=== Context

Some libraries need to create files on a file system.
For example, you want to generate human-readable paper invoices.

=== Decision

We recommend the following conventions when writing unit tests creating files.
Use Google Java in memory file system https://github.com/google/jimfs[Jimfs].
Additional file systems can only be used in Java if all operations are performed through Path objects.
Path objects have a reference to the file system; File objects always referenced the default file system.
When you are writing to the default file system use the root directory ``/tmp/`` available in all Unix like operating systems.

[CAUTION]
====
Avoid writing files to a local file system.
This approach is slow, cumbersome and error-prone.
Use in-memory file systems.
====

=== Consequences

* We have a dependency on an open source product currently managed by Google.
* Use of https://github.com/google/jimfs[Jimfs] requires use of Path instances.
We shall remove all references to File instances.
File instances do not support alternative file systems.
Therefore, we shall use libraries providing a workaround File instances either by using Path instances or reader and writer to access files.
* Operations to physical file system have the risk that rights problems could rise in some continuous integration environment.
