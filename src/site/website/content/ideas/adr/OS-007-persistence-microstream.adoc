== OS-007: Persistence with MicroStream

Date: 2020-11-13

=== Status

Implemented

=== Context

The modules provided as {ref-tangly} open source components are used in more complex applications.
These applications require a reliable and performant persistence approach for their data.

=== Decision

MicroStream was selected as persistence approach for the first versions of the ERP solution.

. Almost no impedance mismatch between the Java application and persistence store
. Elegant approach to provide one persistence container per bounded domain the same application
. MicroStream has formally announced their software library will be published under an open source license
. The library supports current versions of the JDK and all constructs of the language including preview constructs
. The support of the company is good and the answers professional

Care will be taken to provide a fallback to another persistence solution if performance or licensing problems occur.

=== Consequences

* Knowledge in MicroStream library must be build-up.
* Software design must be slightly adapted to the MicroStream approach.
** A clear separation of data from functions is required.
** Lambdas cannot currently be persisted.
 Therefore, all data containers with lambda variables must either be redesigned or declared as transient.
* Work on a design enabling domain driven design with MicroStream approach.

The MicroStream approach supports a very effective way to persist data.
The effort to define storage and map Java objects to a persistent representation are minimal.
This approach minimizes the costs for this functionality without impeding the quality or completeness of the solution.

=== Conventions

. Realm shall have a private data class to store all data to be persisted
. The application must generate unique object identifiers.
 MicroStream does not provide functions in this area.
