=== Context

Applications regularly need to store information in a persistent store.
A proven approach is to use an SQL database solution for such activities.
The Java ecosystem supports a relational database with libraries.

The JPA approach provides an object relational mapper.
The JOOQL approach has a genuine mapping of SQL statements to type verified Java expressions.

=== Decision

The HSQLDB SQL database java solution is the preferred choice when an application needs to store data in a relational store.

Beware the preferred persistence mechanism is link:../os-007-persistence-microstream/[Microstream].

=== Consequences

The advantages of the solution are:
* A simple java library packaged as a jar file provides all the need functionalities.
* The implementation provides an SQL standard compliant solution * the application can embed the database server.
This is a preferred approach in domain-driven design solutions.
* No runtime license costs are required.
The deployment on virtualized and cloud platforms is hugely simplified.

The drawbacks are:
* Best of breed products such PostgreSQL, Oracle, or SQL server are not preferred solutions.
Operations departments have extensive experience with these products but none with HSQLDB.
* The size of the database is limited.
The current limitation is in the level of tens of terabytes.
