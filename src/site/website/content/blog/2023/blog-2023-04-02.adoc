I just received my new MacBookPro M2 Max with 32 GB of RAM and 1 TB SSD
footnote:[I am using Apple products for the last thirty-five years.
I am certainly not objective when discussing the advantages and drawbacks of Apple computers.
I also used Linux based workstations and regularly compiled kernels and configured drivers.
Some companies forced me to use Windows computers.
I learnt to hate virus scanners and firewalls impeding my daily developer tasks.].

I know.
I am a geek who loves his technical gadgets.
I convinced my wife these gadgets are way cheaper than a sports car.

The new notebook replaces my older MacBookPro 2018 I bought five years ago.

The new machine is so fast
footnote:[To be fair, I am not involved in machine learning or vision application development.
Apple support for standard ML libraries is abysmal.
The company decided to create their own standard with https://developer.apple.com/metal/[Metal] and do not assume the consequences.].
It is a pleasure to work with it.
The only visible difference with the older notebook is the new version has a bulkier build.

I decided to set up the machine from the ground up.
I want to find out which programs I am really using in my work.
The setup activities took around one and a half hours
footnote:[The synchronization of the various Cloud storages was performed overnight.
We store company related or personal data either on Cloud drives or in Git repositories.].

The older notebook is now my backup computer.
It can be quite useful.
A battery replacement on a MacBook notebook takes easily one week in Switzerland.

=== Standard Programs

I installed manually the following applications:

Browsers::
- Google Chrome
- Firefox
- _Safari is installed with macOS._
Office Applications::
- https://asciidocfx.com/[AsciiDocFX] _as I write all technical documents using {ref-asciidoc} markup language._
- https://www.libreoffice.org/[LibreOffice] _is my primary office suite for all documents._
- Microsoft Office _is optional in case I receive a related file.
I do not use it for productive work._
- Apple Office Suite _is optional in case I receive a related file.
I do not use it for productive work._
- Conference Tools: Slack, Zoom, Discord, Microsoft Teams, ClickShare
footnote:[I need the ClickShare application because the drivers preinstalled on the ClickShare devices are old and do not work with current macOS versions.].
- Amazon Kindle _because I have all my technical and science-fiction books on Amazon Kindle.
footnote:[Amazon still has not released an ARM native application.
Shame on them.
The worst missing feature is bulk download of purchased books.
I like to explore my library during commute train travel.
You do not have wireless access to trains in Switzerland.
The books shall be stored in the notebook otherwise you cannot read them.]._
- Google Drive to access all our company drives.
- Switch Drive for the Swiss technical university drives.
- Spotify to listen to music.
- https://gpgtools.org/[GPG Tools] to sign all company related emails and encrypt sensitive documents.
I am using PGP for the last thirty years.
- https://excalidraw.com/[Escalidraw]
- Wacom tablet drivers.
- https://www.banana.ch/en/[Banana] for accounting as a local installation.
The complete accounting activities including VAT declarations are performed with this application.
- https://www.videolan.org/vlc/[vlc] as multimedia player
Developer Tools::
- https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/[JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA] with AsciiDoc, Cursive, SonarLint, Statistics, Grazie Professional, and Snyk plugins.
- Java JDK 17 LTS and JDK 20 including the documentation for the latest JDK.
- https://visualvm.github.io/[VisualVM]
- Docker Desktop

[TIP]
====
The JDK documentation shall be copied in the folder _/Library/WebServer/Documents_.
You need _sudo_ rights to move the files into the web server documents folder.

You can access the JavaDoc documentation with URI _localhost/docs-jdk20/api/index.html_.

I need local access to the documentation when travelling in Switzerland.
The official Swiss railway company does not provide Internet access in the trains.

If you never started the Apache server, you need to execute once:

[source,bash]
----
sudo apachectl start
----

=== Brew Packages

https://brew.sh/[Homebrew] is an awesome tool to install libraries, tools and applications on macOS.

image::2023-04-02-homebrew.png[width=600,height=360,role=text-center]

[source,bash]
----
brew install maven gradle git git-lfs node pmd                     <1>
brew install hugo asciidoctor graphviz mermaid-cli                 <2>
brew install clojure leiningen                                     <3>
brew install wget rsync ghostscript                                <4>
brew install --cask asciidocfx                                     <5>

gem install asciidoctor-bibtex asciidoctor-diagram asciidoctor-chart asciidoctor-rouge asciidoctor-kroki    <6>
----

<1> Development tools for Java projects.
Ant is an obsolete tool and no more part of the set.
<2> Documentation tools used to produce all technical documents.
The applications are used to generate static websites.
<3> https://clojure.org/[Clojure] tools for the technical university lectures I gave.
<4> Utilities for developers.
<5> Applications managed through homebrew.
<6> Install the ruby packages used with asciidoctor to create the static websites.

=== Git and GitHub Configuration

I copied the ssh configuration files stored in _.ssh/_ folder on the new machine.
These configuration files handle the access to the multiple remote repositories I am using.

I also set up the shell configuration files _.zshrc_ and _.gitconfig_ to have the same environment.

[NOTE]
====
If you copy your _.ssh_ folder to the new workstation, you could have access right troubles.
_ssh_ is quite restrictive about the access rights of the various files in the configuration folders due to security considerations.
Try the following changes.

[source,bash]
----
sudo chown -R <user> ~/.ssh
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/*

=== Thoughts

All developers in our company are using Apple notebooks since the company's inception.
Our primary development stack is Java.
We are regularly working on embedded industrial products and sometimes use C++.

The Apple ecosystem and the full access to a Unix system validated the assumption that this platform is best for the kinds of product development we are involved in.

The macOS operating system is a cool environment to easily install all the applications you need to work.
The Unix terminal console is a game changer for any software engineer
footnote:[Professional programmers shall have access to a terminal and have local administrator rights.].
The Homebrew package manager streamlines installation and update of needed software packages.

The new MacBookPro is awesome.
It is fast, slick, and the display is gorgeous.
The trade-off is the weight of 2.2 kilograms you have to carry around.
The build-in loudspeakers are always an audible improvement against the sound of the previous machine.

I was surprised how much faster write operations on the build-in solid state disk are.

It is worth the price I paid.
