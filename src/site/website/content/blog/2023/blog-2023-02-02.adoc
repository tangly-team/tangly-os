=== Agile Organization

=== Digital Company

All our internal processes are digital.
The trend towards digital documents, QR Code and digital exchange standards for invoices helps us to extend our digital approaches to our partners and customers.

We still have manual or paper interactions with government platforms and insurance companies.
Swiss government departments provide web portal access to their services.
At least we do not need to send paper documents.
But none of the solutions for social insurances, VAT declaration or salary documents have an API.
Swiss government solutions are still stuck in the last millennium and have missed the API integration approach.

The Swiss federal government deployed a new https://www.estv.admin.ch/estv/en/home.html[Swiss Federal Tax Administration Portal] end of last year.
The various services are now located under one portal.
The solution is still missing a public API to enable the digital transformation of company's processes.

Big insurance companies are iller than the federal government.
Pension fund and accident insurances still request paper correspondence for standardized processes such as mutation or yearly salary structure information.
Improvements are visible but incredibly slow.

We used Google as our main provider of digital applications for daily work.
We have a company account and contract since the inception of our company.
We had to painfully acknowledge that Google has slow innovation and outdated solutions.
Try to publish our Internet sites with their Sites application.
It is cumbersome, no support for {ref-asciidoc} or Markdown is available.
Static website concepts and infrastructure as version managed artifacts are sorely missing.
We initiated a slow withdrawal from their digital offerings.

=== Websites

=== Lessons Learnt

==== BitBucket Platform

The BitBucket offered functionalities are archaic.
Their wiki-based approach with Confluence and Jira is the wrong approach for modern digital product development.
The platform does not support {ref-asciidoc}, CI offerings and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNAME_record[CNAME] support for our static website.
The community requests such improvements for years.

We decided to phase out the usage of BitBucket and use more modern platforms.
We use currently GitHub as our primary platform and GitLab as a fallback solution.

GitHub supports {ref-asciidoc}, has a reasonable CI offering, and their _CNAME_ support is awesome <<cname-github-pages>>.

==== Internet Platforms

Take ownership of the URL for all the cites you own.
Your blogs and documentation often link to articles or pages on various organization websites.
Use your organization domain for all internal links to simplify migration of your sites to another provider
footnote:[We decided to move our static websites from BitBucket to GitHub.
We were surprised how many links had to be changed.].
