There are several benefits to getting an IT certificationâ€”but several costs too.
Certifications can give you the chance to learn needed skills, and be a quick way to show employers you have those skills.
On the other hand, certifications can require studying or coursework, and cost up to several hundred dollars to take.
So how do you know that the benefits will outweigh the costs for you?

Certification or no certification, in the end what matters most is your actual ability to do the job.
Here are a few things to consider as you decide whether to get an IT certification.

=== Java Certifications

If you are a young and ambitious Java developer, ypu must acquire the Oracle certified Java developer certification.
I do not think you will be a better programmer after being certitifed.
The certification program will push you to learn the details of the programming language ant the details of the standard libraries.
This knowledge is the difference between a professional engineer and an amateur one.

The question is if you wan to update your certification each time a new long-term solution is delivered.
Over the years, I acquired the certification for Java 2, 7,8, and 11 releases.
The exam objectives certainly forced me to learn the new features of the language and libraries.
I also discovered some arcane idioms I never used in productive code.

I think a young developer should be certified for her main programming language and technology stack she is using daily.
I also acquired the https://vaadin.com/learn?version=v14[Vaadin certification] because I regularly developed full-stack applicaitons with Java and https://vaadin.com/[Vaadin].

=== Agile Certifications

Agile approaches and Scrum framework are the regular approach to successfully developer software and digital products.
I expect a professional software developer to have a formal training how to apply correctly the Scrum approach.

The two biggest Scrum associations https://www.scrumalliance.org/[Scrum Alliance] and https://www.scrum.org/[Scrum org] provide similar certification paths for Scrum.
For each role you can progress from beginner, over advanced and finally professional certification level.
You should at least pursue the beginner and advanced level to reflect your professionalism.

I often suggest to pursue the certifications of https://www.scrum.org/[Scrum org] because you do need to renew them.
https://www.scrumalliance.org/[Scrum Alliance] requests you to renew your certification every two years and provide proof of continuous training.
This approach is similiar to PMI.

You can find more information in these articles about Scrum master <<scrum-master-formation>>, product owner <<[product-owner-certificaion>> and developer <<scrum-developer-formation>>
certification paths.

I strongly advocate to avoid {ref-safe} trainings because this approach is flawed.
I recognize that sadly {ref-safe} is very popular in big companies.

If you are interested in scaling agile, please consider first a formation and certification in {ref-less}.
I strongly recommend to first master Scrum and lean approaches before tackling scaling approaches in software product development.
