Mutation Testing is a type of software testing in which certain statements of the source code are changed/mutated to check if the test cases are able to find errors in source code.
The goal of Mutation Testing is ensuring the quality of test cases in terms of robustness that it should fail the mutated source code.

The changes made in the mutant program should be kept extremely small that it does not affect the overall objective of the program.
Mutation Testing is also called Fault-based testing strategy as it involves creating a fault in the program and it is a type of White Box Testing which is mainly used for Unit Testing.

https://pitest.org/[Pitest] is a state of the art mutation testing system, providing gold standard test coverage for Java and the jvm.
It's fast, scalable and integrates with modern test and build tooling.
