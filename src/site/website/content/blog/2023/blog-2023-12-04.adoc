=== Model

Embedded design maps domain abstractions to the underlying hardware.

A valve is a domain abstraction of a physical hardware valve.
A physical valve can be a simple opened-closed device, or a proportional device.

The microcontroller board controls the valve through a GPIO, a PWM or a CAN bus controller.
These hardware components map the domain object to the electronics controlling the physical device.

class Model::ValveOnOff {
    + void open();
    + void close();
    + bool isOpen() const;
    - ValveOnOff(const ValveOnOff&) = delete
    - const ValveOnOff& operator=(const ValveOnOff&) = delete
}

class Model::ValveProgressive {
    + void open(uint32_t)
    + uint32_t openess() const;
    - ValveProgressive(const ValveProgressive&) = delete
    - const ValveProgressive& operator=(const ValveProgressive&) = delete
}

class HAL::GPIO {}
class HAL::PWM {}
class HAL::CANController {}

class Vinci::ValveGpio {}
ValveGpio ..> ValveOnOff
ValveGpio o- "1" GPIO : gpio

class Vinci::ValvePwm {}
ValvePwm ..> ValveOnOff
ValvePwm o- "1" PWM : pwm

class Vinci::ValveCan {}
ValveCan ..> ValveProgressive
ValveCan o- "1" CANController : can
----

The designers should decide if a _progressive valve_ is a kind of _on/off valve_ or not.

All instances of the namespaces _HAL_ and _Vinci_ are static and created when the application starts.

The algorithms should ideally only access the abstractions defined in the _model_ namespace.

[CAUTION]
====
The instantiation of objects should define the initialization of abstractions and the underlying physical devices.

Do we start our system and bring all devices to a well-defined initial state?

Or do we start our system, retrieve the state of all devices and initialize our objects accordingly?
This approach is only possible if each hardware component has sensors providing its current state.
====

=== C++ Approach

A physical device shall be mapped to a {cpp} class.
Instances of the class map to existing devices.

Therefore, the copy constructor and the copy operator should be disabled.
The physical devices are defined through the machine the software controls.

The software accesses the physical device through an electronics interface such as a GPIO, PWM or CAN controller.
The mapping between the electronic component and the physical device is hardwired at construction.

class ValveOnOff {
public:
    void open();
    void close();
    bool isOpen() const;
private:
    ValveOnOff(const ValveOnOff&) = delete;                           <1>
    const ValveOnOff& operator=(const ValveOnOff&) = delete;          <2>
    bool _opened = false;                                             <3>
};

<1> A physical device cannot be replicated.
<2> A physical device cannot be copied.
<3> Imply that the application resets the system when booting.

=== Interrupt Routines

Output devices do not need interrupts.
A driver provides a function to output the new value on the electronics.
As an example, the function writes the new value to a memory-mapped register.
The designer is responsible to avoid concurrent access to the register.

Input devices should always support interrupts.
Otherwise, the application must poll registers to detect changes.
Polling is cumbersome and expensive.
Either the programmer guesses a polling frequency and misses sometimes data.
Or he chooses a high-frequency sampling rate and wastes computing resources.

Two major interrupt approaches exist:

- The interrupt routine reads the new value of the sensor and stores the data at a defined location.
The application accesses the sensor stored value when needed.
+
This approach decouples the application from the external sensors.
The drawback is that the program is not informed when a new value is received.
- The interrupt routine reads the new value and sends the value as a message to interested parties.
+
The approach is a reactive system triggering the application each time input data is received.

The interrupt routine or the underlying hardware can handle sensor inputs in two ways:

- Data is retrieved regularly.
This synchronous approach gives a rhythm to the system but often uses computing resources without gains.
- Data is retrieved when a value has changed.
Either the hardware detects the change or the interrupt routine compares the received data with the stored value.
+
This approach is purely reactive.
Algorithms are only triggered when the external system has changed.

[TIP]
====
I recommend interrupt triggering input data gathering and reacting to input *changes*.

This design approach minimizes microcontroller resource consumption and simplifies the control algorithms.

=== Lessons Learnt

Try to define the simplest model to implement your features.
Follow the {ref-kiss} principle.

Model the physical world.
A valve, a GPIO, a CAN controller are real things.
Model them.
Do not try to hide things.

The introductory book _Realtime {cpp}_ cite:[realtime-cpp] is a rigorous introduction how to program microcontrollers in {cpp}.
You learn how to access hardware resources from {cpp} and what are the costs of various {cpp} constructs.

Use the actor pattern to implement thread communication <<distributed-asynchronous-systems>> <<actors-in-cpp>> <<actors-cmsis-cpp>>.
