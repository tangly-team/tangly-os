Java 20 was released on time to the public.
Interestingly, the new Java release contains only incubating or preview JEP proposals.

Project https://openjdk.org/projects/amber/[Amber] provided improvements in pattern matching features.

Project https://openjdk.org/projects/loom/[Loom] provided refinements in virtual threads and structured concurrency.

Project https://openjdk.org/projects/panama/[Panama] refined accessed to functions and data provided by external libraries written in non-JVM languages.

=== Algebraic Types and Pattern Matching

=== Virtual Threads and Structured Concurrency

=== Interfaces to external libraries and memory structures

=== Thoughts

Java is improving steadily if sometimes slowly.

The diagram shows the hot topics in the Java ecosystem.
The adoption takes time before a majority of development organizations jump on the train.
The adoption of the Java 17 LTS edition is still in the early adoption phase after two years.
We should rather state that the mojority of Java teams are laggards.
