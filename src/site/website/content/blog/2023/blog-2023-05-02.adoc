Java 20 was released on time to the public.
Interestingly, the new Java release contains only incubating or preview JEP proposals.

Project https://openjdk.org/projects/amber/[Amber] provided improvements in pattern matching features.
Project https://openjdk.org/projects/loom/[Loom] provided refinements in virtual threads and structured concurrency.
Project https://openjdk.org/projects/panama/[Panama] refined accessed to functions and data provided by external libraries written in non-JVM languages.
