The static website build tool {ref-hugo} is awesome.

The extensive built-in feature set of Hugo and the feature-rich text-formatting options that Asciidoc offers creates a blogging experience composed of easy content management and fun writing experience.

The Hugo theme Docsy is ideal to create a good-looking software documentation site.
The templates for blogging are good enough for our needs.

This theme is currently the best match I found to combine product documentation with blogging.

I love to write my documentation and blogs using {ref-asciidoc} notation.
The expression power covers all our needs.
A major tool chain is the {ref-asciidoctor} ecosystem.

Lately, I needed new features to ameliorate the usability of our open-source documentation and blogging site.

I had to deepen my understanding of how Hugo is working with themes.

== Tabs

I wanted to display {ref-plantuml} diagrams and the associated code side by side in my article.
The tab approach is perfect and lets the reader switch between both views in her browser.

{asciidoctor} provides an extension to support tabular display
footnote:[The extension is still beta level end of 2023.].

The trick was to integrate the extension in {ref-hugo} and {ref-docsy}.

. The stylesheet for {ref-asciidoc} was extended to handle the tabular notation.
The {asciidoctor} crew provides a styling example.
Find my _scss_ stylesheet under {ref-asciidoc-docsy-stylesheet}.
. Add the Javascript code to react to user selections.
Find my _javascript_ code under {ref-asciidoc-tabs-js}.
. The script code shall be included in the {ref-hugo} partials.
Find the _HTML_ code under {ref-hugo-partials} in the file _footer.html_.

An article using this functionality is link:../../2023/c4-and-uml-with-plantuml[C4 and UML with plantUML].

I hope that the tabular display extension will soon graduate to an official {ref-asciidoc} extension.

== Attachments

I am a lecturer at {ref-cs-hslu}.
All my course materials are under {ref-cc-by-sa}.

I wanted to provide recommended reading materials as a list of downloadable documents on the website.

How can you provide this function with {ref-hugo} and {ref-docsy}?

The {ref-docsy} theme as a merge request for exactly this function.
The request was created in June 2021.
It is still open end of November 2023, more than two years later
footnote:[You can read the pull request under {ref-docsy}.
Select the pull requests tab.].

I decided to add the necessary code as a local extension to the docsy theme.

. Add the {ref-hugo} shortcodes to the theme under {ref-hugo-shortcodes} in the file _attachments.html_
. Add my _scss_ stylesheet under {ref-asciidoc-docsy-stylesheet} in the file _shortcodes.scss_.

A document using this functionality is {ref-tangly-blog-url}/ideas/learnings/lectures/[Lectures].
The page displays multiple lists of documents.
The reader can download the material she is interested in.

== Mundane Work

I invested quite some time to improve the layout of the blog articles in the context of the {ref-docsy} theme.
{ref-hugo} supports {ref-asciidoc} out of the box.
It does not mean that the layout is perfect.

Another tedious activity is to remove broken links from the website.

The {ref-asciidoc} stylesheet had to be extended to support the additional features I am using.

The work is low tech.
But I am convinced that users will appreciate the improvements.
