You will find that Java expertise is in high demand for all kinds of projects, ranging from big enterprise software implementations down to little web projects.
But will those employers want you to have related certifications?

Even if you are not looking to move any time soon, getting certified boosts the value that you can bring to your organization.
Certifications can be a great bargaining chip when it comes to negotiating a raise or a promotion.

=== Preparing for the certification

The preparation shall be tailored how you prefer to learn.
You can attend a course or read a book.

The https://www.amazon.com//dp/B09WJP11JL/[OCP Oracle Certified Professional Java SE 17 Developer Study Guide: Exam 1Z0-829] is a great and cost effective resource.
You have access to all materials for less than forty dollars.

=== Mockup Questions

Try the various online mockup questions to get a grasp of the certification examination.
The OCP book contains a full set of questions and answers.

=== Taking the examination

I strongly recommend attending an onsite examination.
The setup is more convenient than the online version of the test.

=== Lessons Learnt

- Reat the whole book to prepare for the examination
- Train with mockup questions.
Do not focus on memorizing the questions.
- Try to relax during the examination.
Do not stay to long on one question.
Each question has the same weight for passing the examination.
