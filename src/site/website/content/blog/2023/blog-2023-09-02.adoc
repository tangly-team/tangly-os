Java 21 LTS was released on time to the public.
The release is available for download since 21^st^ September 2023.

Pattern matching is maturing nicely.
The hope is that more solutions will more advanced data stream manipulation and functional programming algorithms.
Complex inheritance structure are no more considered as good practices in regular application.
The pattern matching extensions nicely provide idioms to solve similar design problems.

The support for virtual threads is reaching full integration in the official Java distribution.
Extensions such as scoped values are available as preview feature.
The tail-call optimization for recursive calls is sadly still missing.

=== Amber Project

The https://openjdk.org/projects/amber/[amber] initiative is completing the changes with pattern matching.

- https://openjdk.org/jeps/440[Record Patterns]
- https://openjdk.org/jeps/441[Patten Matching for switch]
- https://openjdk.org/jeps/443[Unnamed Patterns and Variables (Preview)]

The syntactic improvements initiated by Amber and core group are;

- https://openjdk.org/jeps/431[Sequenced Collections]

=== Loom Project

The https://openjdk.org/projects/loom/[loom] initiative is completing the major changes associated with virtual threads.

=== Panama Project

The panama initiative is iterating through their interfaces.
They synchronize as much as possible their interfaces with the Valhalla and Lilliput activities.

- https://openjdk.org/jeps/448[Vector API] _Sixth Incubator_
- https://openjdk.org/jeps/442[Foreign Function & Memory API] _Third Preview_

=== Valhalla Project

As usual, the https://openjdk.org/projects/valhalla/[Valhalla] initiative did not release any improvements in the current release.

=== Lilliput and Leyden Projects

The https://openjdk.org/projects/lilliput/[lilliput] initiative aims to reduce memory usage.

=== Miscellaneous Improvements

Obsolete features are removed:

Extensions to existing features:

- https://openjdk.org/jeps/404[Generational Shenandoah (Experimental)]
- https://openjdk.org/jeps/439[Generational ZGC]
- https://openjdk.org/jeps/445[Unnamed Classes and Instance Main Methods (Preview)]
