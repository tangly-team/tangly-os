Java 21 LTS was released on time to the public.
The release has been available for download since 21^st^ September 2023.

Pattern matching is maturing nicely.
The hope is that more solutions will more advanced data stream manipulation and functional programming algorithms.
Complex inheritance structure are no more considered as good practices in regular application.
The pattern matching extensions nicely provide idioms to solve similar design problems.

The support for virtual threads is reaching full integration in the official Java distribution.
Extensions such as scoped values are available as preview feature.
The tail-call optimization for recursive calls is sadly still missing.

== Amber Project

The https://openjdk.org/projects/amber/[amber] initiative is completing the changes with pattern matching.
Start adapting your coding idioms and use pattern matching.

The visitor pattern can simply be implemented as switch expression with pattern matching.
As a bonus, the compiler will verify completeness if your class hierarchy uses sealed inheritance.

- https://openjdk.org/jeps/441[Patten Matching for switch]
- https://openjdk.org/jeps/443[Unnamed Patterns and Variables (Preview)]

The syntactic improvements initiated by Amber and core group are;

- https://openjdk.org/jeps/430[String Templates] _Preview_
- https://openjdk.org/jeps/431[Sequenced Collections]

The string template feature is worth the effort to study the provided functions.
My code could be considerably simplified when using this functionality.

== Loom Project

The https://openjdk.org/projects/loom/[loom] initiative is completing the major changes associated with virtual threads.

- https://openjdk.org/jeps/444[Virtual Threads]
- https://openjdk.org/jeps/446[Scoped Values] _Preview_
- https://openjdk.org/jeps/453[Structured Concurrency] _Preview_

Virtual threads are now official part of the Java universe.
Your design can create as many threads as you want without restrictions.

_Most of the Java developers never create directly thread instances._
_The feature is useful for library and framework creators._

== Panama Project

The panama initiative is iterating through their interfaces.
They synchronize as much as possible their interfaces with the Valhalla and Lilliput activities.

- https://openjdk.org/jeps/448[Vector API] _Sixth Incubator_
- https://openjdk.org/jeps/442[Foreign Function & Memory API] _Third Preview_

== Valhalla Project

As usual, the https://openjdk.org/projects/valhalla/[Valhalla] initiative did not release any improvements in the current release.

_It is time that value objects are proposed in the near future._
_The project is going for ten years._

== Lilliput and Leyden Projects

The https://openjdk.org/projects/lilliput/[lilliput] initiative aims to reduce memory usage.

== Miscellaneous Improvements

Obsolete features are removed:

- https://openjdk.org/jeps/449[Deprecate the Windows 32-bit x86 Port for Removal]
- https://openjdk.org/jeps/451[Prepare to Disallow the Dynamic Loading of Agents]

Extensions to existing features:

- https://openjdk.org/jeps/439[Generational ZGC]
- https://openjdk.org/jeps/445[Unnamed Classes and Instance Main Methods (Preview)]
- https://openjdk.org/jeps/452[Key Encapsulation Mechanism API]

== Stumbling Blocks

Once again {ref-lombok} up to version 1.18.28 is not working with JDK 21
footnote:[Version 1.18.30 was released in 2023-09-20 and provides initial support for JDK 21.
Late but it still saves the day.].
The project uses internal unsafe functions, which are no more supported in this Java release.

[TIP]
====
The edge snapshot release has experimental support for JDK 21.
You need the following additions in your {ref-gradle} configuration.

- add the repository _maven { url "https://projectlombok.org/edge-releases" }_
- use the dependency _org.projectlombok:lombok:edge-SNAPSHOT_ for the library and the annotation processor
====

All other libraries and tools I am using worked without troubles.
Major libraries test their current release with early-access and solve the problems before the official release a new Java version.

== Lessons Learnt

Gradle toolchain feature simplifies experimenting with a new Java version.
The current version of {ref-gradle} runs under Java 21.

IntelliJ IDE provides support for newer JDK before their official release.
It tremendously simplifies exploration of new features.

Often you can use the continuous integration pipelines of {ref-github} or {ref-gitlab} platforms.
No virtual machines with an experimental Java version are available.

Use different distributions to harden your code and explore alternative solutions.
The https://www.eclipse.org/[Eclipse] foundation https://adoptium.net/temurin/[temurin] distribution is very nice.

Migrate all your active products to the new Java version.
Invest effort to enhance source code and use the new features.
So, you will avoid technical obsolesce and geriatric applications.
