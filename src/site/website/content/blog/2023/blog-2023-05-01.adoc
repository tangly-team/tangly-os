[quote,Michael Feathers]
____
OO makes code understandable by encapsulating moving parts.
FP makes code understandable by minimizing moving parts.
____

Functional languages have the following properties:

* Functions are first-class objects.
That is, functions can be created at runtime, passed around, returned, and in general, used like any other datatype.
* Data is immutable.
* Functions are pure; that is, they have no side effects.

For many tasks, functional programs are easier to understand, less error prone, and much easier to reuse.

____
Purely functional programs typically operate on immutable data.
Instead of altering existing values, altered copies are created and the original is preserved.
Since the unchanged parts of the structure cannot be modified, they can often be shared between the old and new copies, which saves memory.
