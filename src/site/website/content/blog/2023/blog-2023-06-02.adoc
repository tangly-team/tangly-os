Functional programming is hype for the last ten years.

All popular programming languages have added support to functional concepts for years.

Not all developers are embracing the new approach and using the provided constructs.

I often have to read source code which uses only idioms defined in the last millennium.
I cringed and ask myself why developers are writing such awkward code?

What does it mean to code with functional paradigms?

I have an interesting test to decide if your code is embracing functional programming approaches:

. You are using library methods with formal parameters being functions.
. You use map, filter, reduce and apply operations instead of conditional control blocks.
Loops and conditional statements are almost disappearing in your code.
. You declared in your own methods functions as formal parameters.
. You declared in at least one of your methods a return type being a function.

Clojure is a very nice language to learn functional programming idioms.

=== Functional Thinking

The key functional concepts of Clojure are:

- All data structures are per default immutable.
Lists, vectors, maps, sets, records are all immutable.
- Functions are https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_function[first-class functions].
You can also state that functions are first-class citizens.
This means that functions have the same functionality as objects.
For example, they can be assigned to variables, passed in as arguments, or returned from a function.

[source,clojure]
----
(defrecord Person [^String firstname ^String lastname])         <1>

(def aPerson (->Person "John" "Doe"))                           <2>
;; or (def aPerson (Person. "John" "Doe"))

(:firstname aPerson)                                            <3>
;; => "John"
(:lastname aPerson)
;; => "Doe

(def anotherPerson (assoc aPerson :firstname "Jane"))           <4>
;; => Jane doe
----

<1> Define a new record _Person_ with two string properties _firstname_ and _lastname_.
<2> Create a new record instance with firstname _John_ and lastname _Doe_ and assiociates it with reference _aPerson_.
<3> Return the firstname of _aPerson_.
<4> Create a new record instance with the values of _aPerson_ and the new value _Jane_ for the _firstname_.

[source,clojure]
----
(defn factorial-loop [^BigDecimal x]
  (loop [n x prod 1]
    (if (= 1 n)
      prod
      (recur (dec n) (* prod n)))))                         <1>

(defn factorial-tail-recursion [^BigDecimal x]
  (letfn [f [result n]
    (if (= n 1)
        result
        (recur (* result n) (dec n)))]                      <2>
  (f 0 x)))
----

<1> The _recur_ expression evaluates the new values for all loop variables and restart the loop with these values.
<2> The _recur_ expression evaluates the new values for all function parameters and restart the function without addind a new stack frame.
This mechanism provides tail-recursion call optimization.

[source,clojure]
----
(defn greet                                                 <1>
     ([] (greet "you"))
     ([name] (print "Hello" name)))

(greet)
;; => Hello you

(greet "World")
;; => Hello World

(defn greet [name & rest] (print "Hello" name rest))        <2>

(greet "Yan" "Darryl" "Deepu" "Tom")
;; => Hello Yan (Darryl Deepu Tom)
----

<1> Define a multi-arity function.
One declaration is without parameter, the second one has one parameter.
<2> Deine a variadic function with a variable number of parameters as last formal parameter.

=== Advanced Functional Constructs

The regular mapping, filtering, reducing and applying functions are fully supported in Clojure.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_application[Partial application] to reduce the arity of a function is supported with the _apply_ construct.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization[Memoization] is also provided.
Beware of the tradeoff between processing improvement versus memory consumption.

[source,clojure]
----
(map inc [1 2 3 4 5])
;;=> (2 3 4 5 6)

(filter even? (range 10))
;;=> (0 2 4 6 8)

(reduce + [1 2 3 4 5])
;;=> 15

(apply str ["str1" "str2" "str3"])
;;=> "str1str2str3"

;; partial application on the add function
(defn add [x y] (+ x y))
(def adder (partial add 5))
(adder 1)

;; memoization of function calls
(def memoized-fibonacci
  (memoize (fn [n]
             (condp = n
               0 1
               1 1
               (+ (m-fib (dec n)) (m-fib (- n 2)))))))
----

=== Synchronization Concepts

Concurrency is built into the language.
Rich Hickey designed Clojure to specifically address the problems that develop from shared access to mutable state.
Clojure embodies a very clear conception of state that makes it inherently safer for concurrency than most popular programming languages.

Three concepts shall cover all your concurrency needs.

Atoms::
https://clojure.org/reference/atoms[Atoms] provide a way to manage shared, synchronous, independent state.
Atom allows you to endow a succession of related values with an identity.
Atoms are an efficient way to represent some state that will never need to be coordinated with any other, and for which you wish to make synchronous changes
Refs and Transactions::
https://clojure.org/reference/refs[Refs] allow you to update the state of multiple identities using transaction semantics.
These transactions have three features:
- They are atomic, meaning that all refs are updated or none of them are.
- They are consistent, meaning that the refs always appear to have valid states.
A sock will always belong to a dryer or a gnome, but never both or neither.
- They are isolated, meaning that transactions behave as if they executed serially.
If two threads are simultaneously running transactions that alter the same ref, one transaction will retry.
This is similar to the compare-and-set semantics of atoms.
+
You might recognize these as the _A_, _C_, and _I_ in the _ACID_ properties of database transactions.
You can think of refs as giving you the same concurrency safety as database transactions, only with in-memory data.
Clojure uses software transactional memory _STM_ to implement this behavior.
Agents::
https://clojure.org/reference/agents[Agents] are a mechanism for sequencing operations on a particular instance of a data structure.
Agents provide independent, asynchronous change of individual locations.
Agents are bound to a single storage location for their lifetime, and only allow mutation of that location (to a new state) to occur as a result of an action.

[source,clojure]
----
;; Atoms

(def state (atom {})                              <1>
(swap! (state assoc :x 42))                       <2>

(println @state)                                  <3>
;; @state is equivalent to (deref state)

;; References

(def account-a (ref 100))                         <4>
(def account-b (ref 100))

(defn transfer! [amount from to]
  (dosync                                         <5>
   (if (>= (- @from amount) 0)
     (do
       (alter from - amount)                      <6>
       (alter to + amount)))))

;; Agents

(def x (agent 0))                                 <7>
(defn increment [c n] (+ c n))
(send x increment 5)                              <8>
;; @x -> 5
(send x increment 10)
;; @x -> 15
----

<1> Declare an atom.
<2> Update the value of the atom.
The expression passed as parameter to _swap!_ is applied to the current value of the atom.
<3> Gets the current value of the atom.
<4> Declare a reference.
<5> Define the transactional parenthesis grouping multiple modifications of references.
<6> The behavior of alter is . Reach outside the transaction and read the reference's current state.
. Compare the current state to the state the ref started with within the transaction.
. If the two differ, make the transaction retry.
Otherwise, commit the altered ref state.
<7> Declare an agent.
<8> Send the expression to the agent.
The expression is executed asynchronously using a thread pool.
The first parameter of the expression will be the agent value.

[NOTE]
====
*Atoms* allow multiple threads to apply transformations to a single value and guarantee the transformations are atomic.
_swap!_ takes the atom and a function expecting the current value of the atom.
The result of calling that function with the current value is stored in the atom. multiple calls to swap! may interleave, but each call will run in isolation.

*Refs* allow multiple threads to update multiple values in a co-ordinated way.
All updates to all refs inside a sync will complete or none will.
You *must* write your code such that transaction retries are catered for.
There are a few potential performance tweaks, if you can relax the ordering of operations, which *may* reduce the chance of transaction retry.

=== Embrace Modern Java

Modern Java adds functional approaches cite:[functional-programming-java] to the Java language.
I will certainly not pretend that Java is a functional language.
You still can go a long way and write more functional and legible code using the provided mechanisms.

The major constructs are:

- Lambda Functions and Java Functional Idioms
- Streams and Monoids
- Algebraic Data Types and Pattern Matching
- Structured Concurrency and Virtual Threads

Functional Java means no more _for_, _while_, and _do_ loops
footnote:[Recursion is sufficient to have a Turing complete language. Loops are not required.].

Functional Java means no more checks if a value has the value _null_.

Virtual Threads means no more asynchronous programming.

[CAUTION]
====
Java still does not support tail optimization.
This constraint limits the use of recursive constructs in your solution.

Partial application is painful in Java due to the type declarations implied with the single abstract method interface approach for lambdas.
Try using _var_ as much as possible.
Otherwise, you need to type very lengthy type declarations.
====

=== Lessons Learnt

Clojure is an ideal language to learn and better understand functional programming approaches cite:[functional-thinking].

You will probably not use it in a commercial product development.
None of the functional languages such as Clojure, List, F# has taken over the world of programmers.

The principles you learnt shall often be applicable to your technology stack.
Your code will certainly be simpler, more legible and maintainable.

I wish you happy coding in the functional world of Clojure.
