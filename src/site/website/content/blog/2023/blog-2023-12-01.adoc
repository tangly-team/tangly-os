Advantages::
Great Flexibility:::
You can do everything within the build script as you write them with the full-fledged programming language Groovy.
Great Performance:::
Gradle does an awesome job in speeding up your builds with features like incremental builds, daemons and clustered builds.
Drawbacks::
Steep learning curve:::
Moreover, the whole team has to learn Gradle or you will be depending on the single Gradle ninja in your team.
Groovy or Kotlin DSL:::
The dynamic Groovy DSL and the heterogeneous plugin APIs will make you google everything.
Unexpected side-effects, behavior, and interdependencies between plugins. It often feels like magic.
As Groovy is dynamically typed, it’s really hard for IDEs to provide good and fast (!) tooling. Contrarily, parsing and interpreting Maven’s XML is dead simple.
Breaking Changes:::
New Gradle versions are often breaking existing plugins and the poor maintainer of this one-man-open-source-projects can’t keep up with this speed.
