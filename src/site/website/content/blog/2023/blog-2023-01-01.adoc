It is not unusual for businesses to turn to third-party companies when they want help to achieve their goals without increasing internal overhead.

This type of outsourcing is especially common for projects that require tremendous amounts of effort or specific skill sets
footnote:[The demography change and the low unemployment rate make timely recruiting of professional engineers an almost impossible task.].

Time constraints are often a supplemental driving factor.

Partnering up with another business to help meet your needs is a viable and widespread solution
footnote:[Another approach is to build an internal group and develop the solution.
The costs of a team with ten collaborators and an investment horizon of five years would be at least 10 MCHF in Switzerland.
It is a steep investment that takes time to be planned in a regular organization.
The time and the readiness to invest are often not available in a timely manner.].
It often makes sense for businesses trying to tackle a massive software development project while focusing on the current needs of their clients.

=== Evaluation

A professional and planned approach greatly improves the odds of success for the partnership:

Identify Decision Criteria::
Decide on your internal team, which helps with making and supporting the decision.
Put together a _must-have_ checklist for the capabilities required from a software solution company. +
+
Research different approaches and methodologies to discuss with your potential business partner.
For instance, will you use Agile and should your partner need to practice it as well?
Should you emphasize corporate governance or technology agility? +
+
Think about the services your business will need in the next few years.
Will you require an entire development team, including help with product support? +
Consider the types of roles required to build your solution and note those you can fulfill with your internal staff.
Which positions will you need to fill with experts or dedicated people provided by your new partner?
Evaluate Candidates::
Ultimately, you want to choose a partner with the right experience to help you achieve your goals<<evaluate-cv>>.
Avoid choosing a company just because they work with trendy technologies or because they list tons of services on their website. +
+
The length of time they have been in business can be important.
The length of time they have worked with their own clients can be more telling of the level of expertise they provide.
Evaluate Costs, Processes and Tools::
You may be tempted to select the lowest cost option but be cautious.
The software company with the lowest bid might not be the most cost-effective.
You risk choosing a partner that will go fast but make mistakes, or complete chunks of the work and then need to redo them to match your standards. +
+
Do not risk quality and reputation for a good price.
Ask about change orders.
Many companies will underbid a project and later add on new charges throughout the project.
It results a dramatic increase in the overall cost of development. +
+
It is true that aspects of your project will change during the development process.
Experienced software development companies should help you understand how they will handle changes while protecting both your budget and your timeline. +
+
Discuss the thorny aspect of scale up and down your external development team. +
What are the consequences for you and your partner?

Consider the Location::
Where will you want your external development partner to be <<agile-near-shore>>? +
+
If it is important that they can integrate with your team and frequently work on site, you might want to only look at local software companies.
Evaluate travel time and not the distance to your partner offices. +
+
If you are open to working remotely with an onshore company, hold early conversations using the potential conferencing, documentation, and chat systems.
You want to ensure your development team can provide help by video as much is lost in exclusively email team communications. +
+
Do not forget to account for travel in your budget if you shall expect it from your software development team.
If you are thinking of offshoring the work, be sure you consider how you will handle the difference in time zones and communication styles.
Many companies offer low-cost solutions that include working with offshore teams to handle services like the help desk, product support, and simple development.
Start Searching::
Do not forget to keep track of your search as you go.
Create a document that records potential companies, their attributes, who you are talked to, what you have learned, and any decisions you have made.
Ask Tough Questions::
Learn what challenges they have faced with previous clients and what they did to overcome them.
If there is something you are particularly worried about, ask about their experience dealing with your prospective challenges to helping their other clients with similar solutions in the past<<detecting-agile-bullshit>>.
Ask about their best clients, and the ones that did not stick around. +
+
Be sure they have clearly outlined what you can expect from working with their team, how you will measure progress, and how they help define success. +
+
Be wary of any potential development partner that struggles to answer these questions or does not provide stories of failure or follow them up with concrete ways theyâ€™ve adapted to ensure future success for their clients.
