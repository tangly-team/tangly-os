I attended the highly anticipated 20th edition of Devoxx Belgium 2023.

Building on the success of the previous year, which attracted over 3,200 attendees, this five-day technology conference is set to exceed expectations.

The fresh release of Java 21 is a hot topic.
Renowned speakers share their knowledge and discuss the enhancements that this new version brings, providing a valuable learning opportunity.

Attending Devoxx Belgium presents a remarkable opportunity to broaden your knowledge, refine your skills, and gain firsthand experience with the most recent technologies.

Session recordings are available on YouTube under the {ref-devoxx-channel}.
The videos are published on the same day the talk was held.
Congratulations to the Devoxx committee.

Most of the talks were good.
A few were excellent such as <<awesome-speech-llm>>.
The Oracle Java architects are doing a stunning job.
They are very professional, polite, and their talks are of high-quality.
Brian Goetz and Per Minborg made a big impression on how competent they are
footnote:[I still think that Oracle Java license conditions are crazy.
You have to pay 250 USD per collaborator.
Nothing to do with how many developers you have or how many applications you are running.].

My favorite tool companies {ref-jetbrains}, {ref-vaadin}, and {ref-oracle} were exhibitors.

=== Day One

The train ride from Brussels airport to Antwerp is around half an hour.

The venue is easy to find and has splendid public transportation connections.
The registration was straightforward and fast.
Wireless is working.

It was saddening that most attendees are white male engineers.
Perhaps the conference committee should more actively pursue diversity.
Other conferences try very hard to attract less represented groups in particular women.

The coffee was lousy as usual at a software conference
footnote:[Agile conferences have often a real coffee machine and a barista.
I promise it is not the reason why I also attend agile congresses.].
The danish pastries were welcome.

==== Test Containers: Needed, Simple, Powerful

Integration tests verify your application is working as expected.

Test containers is a powerful wrapper around docker.
You can create the integration environment and the continuous delivery pipeline in Java.

[sidebar]
Test containers seem to lower the anxiety how to set up an integration environment and deploy the application on it.

If you prefer to write and debug your integration setup in Java, test containers are useful.
The demonstration highlighted you have anyway to learn the subtleties of Docker.
You can write your setup code in Java, but it requires quite knowledge about the underlying tooling.

A cool hint was {ref-toxiproxy} to simulate network delays and errors.

Alternative approaches are docker compose or plugins such as jib.

_I am still not convinced the gains using test containers are worth learning a new library._
_The assumption is you are already proficient with {ref-docker} and {ref-docker-compose}._

==== Java 21

The introduction was well-done.
Honestly, if you read the JSR and articles during the early-adopter phase, you did not get new information during the presentation.

_The presentation is for Java developers lagging behind the latest Java LTS release._
_Modern developers evaluate a new Java version before it is officially released._

==== Value Types and Patterns Matching

Data oriented programming separate data and code.
This approach is against core concepts of object-oriented programming.

The speakers talked about the disadvantages of recompiling code when changing an interface.
But honestly what are the costs of compiling in a modern {ref-devops} environment?

The advantage of declaring a static method instead of a default method in the interface is not visible for me.

Use sealed class hierarchies, pattern matching in switch expressions to delegate complex business logic inside business classes.
Consider using records to write less code and move in the direction of immutable instances.
Deconstruction patterns and unnamed variables make the algorithms more legible.

Avoid {ref-anemic-domain-model}.
I acknowledge there is a tension between behavior which should be part of a class and complex business logic which should be defined separately from the core domain.

[CAUTION]
====
If you are not the owner of the code, you want to extend it using:

Polymorphism:: You can add new subtypes and cannot create new operations.
Functional:: You can add new operations but cannot create new subtypes.
====

The above constraint clearly defines the tension in designing the abstractions for a bounded domain.

An experienced architect with domain knowledge should hint which functionalities belong to a class and which ones are better located in business logic abstractions.

Future constructs were also presented.

Named patterns is a discussion theme in the community.
They support the deconstruction of regular classes.

Value classes as potential first preview of the {ref-valhalla} project.
Value instances have no identity anc can be stored on the stack.
Interestingly, the optimization is only done at runtime.

They stated discussions is under to integrate null annotation in the language as discussed in {ref-jspecify}
footnote:[The restriction is that the community agrees upon the check definitions.].

[TIP]
====
Modern Java programmers implement the _equals(Object obj)_ method with _instanceof_ and not _if_ statement.

The statement _if (this == obj)_ is a performance killer when compared with the modern approach.
====

==== Getting Started with the Structurizr DSL

Simon Brown provided a nice introduction to {ref-c4}: Context, Container, Component, and Code.

The explanations of Structurizr DSL and examples were interesting.

- Multiple diagrams can be defined in _views_.
The types are _systemContext_, _container_, and _component_.
- You can manipulate the diagrams with scripts.
- The model stores semantic relations between the various elements.
- You can use the command line to generate all views as regular or C4 plantUML diagrams.

The examples showed that often you start programming diagram items and contents.

_The major drawback is that {ref-structurizr} wants to be the ruler of your documentation._
_You cannot create a static website with the diagrams and the links between them._
_The tool plantUML supports such features through the SVG output._ +
_Instead {ref-structurizr} requires that your {ref-asciidoc} or {ref-arc42} documents are integrated into it._

[NOTE]
====
You can export the content of a model to an HTML page.

It is not the same as generating a static website with a static generator and theme.
Generators such as {ref-hugo} provides mechanisms to generate links and cross-references to link various parts of your documentation.
====

The idea to add a semantic abstraction layer to diagramming tools is brilliant.
I think the current solution should be improved to simplify diagram handling.

=== Day Two

I found a nice coffee shop in town to get a real coffee and a cinnamon roll.
Loaded with caffeine and sugar, I am ready to tackle the second conference day.

==== Know Your Java?

Entertaining and professional presentation of Java quirks.
The examples show Java software archeology.

[quote,Venkat Subramaniam]
____
Don't Walk Away From Complexity, Run.

Speed without Discipline: a Recipe for Disaster.
____

New features have sometimes strange impacts on existing code, often due to bad naming or interface segregation troubles.

[TIP]
====
Learn the language and the standard API.

Study functional programming, pure function, immutable data structure concepts.
Java mixes object-orientation and functional programming.
The compiler performs limited checks if your functional code behaves correctly.

As a young developer, consider taking the Java developer certification examination.
====

==== Test-Driven Insights: 10 Hints You Were Missing

Funny examples of how to write unit tests for crap code.
The end of the talk presented good design approaches and the need to refactor.
The speaker Victor Rentea outed himself as a clean-code advocate.

Rely on the language and not on tests to detect errors is a profound advice.

The {cpp} bashing was surprising.

The attendees hinted that a lot of legacy code exists.
Developers are under the yoke of maintaining and extending geriatric solutions.

_I rather advocate performing refactoring to remove technical debt before trying to add functionality._
_I fully agree that there are rare exceptions due to important business deadlines._
_Here you could use the tricks with mocks, partial mocks, breaking information hiding to test legacy code._

_Be honest._
_I would never work on a crap software code application._
_Either the company is resolute with professionalism and supports refactoring._
_Or I would look out for a serious development environment._

==== Microservices Got Talent: The Event-Driven Beautiful Dance

Event-first design is another approach to look at your domain.

Ensures there are event handlers for all emitted events before they are effectively persisted.
The event sourcing runtime should ensure the approach.

- Validate the command.
Execute the commands sequentially on your model.
- Mutate the state by applying the events
- Persist the events Do not use Java serialization.
Think about schema evolution.
JSON is fine, but you have to manually implement schema changes. +
Performant approaches are {ref-avro} or {ref-protobuf} which support schema evolution. +
{ref-eclipsestore} is a potential candidate.
The event sourcing runtime is responsible to load events into memory and removes them from memory for a specific instance in the domain model.

Projections are used to process events and create a query optimized views on the model.
The concept is similar to a materialized view in a relational database.
Events are sent at least once to projection event handlers
footnote:[Exactly once is only available for local services using a transactional backend.].
Scalability is realized through slicing of the event store.
The slicing property is the stable identifier of the entity referenced in the event.
Design your system accordingly.

Choreography sagas are completely based on events and projections.
Once triggered, it moves like a wave until completion.
Therefore, no error should block the flow and they are hard to debug.

You can use complex sagas with orchestration tools such as https://temporal.io/[Temporal] or https://camunda.com/[Camunda].
A trend is to offer PaaS solutions built around a kubernetes cluster.

==== With Java 21, Your Code Runs Even Faster. But How is that Possible?

The presentation was fun, instructive and well-done.
The details were inspiring and of high-quality.
The speaker showed multiple areas where the JVM was locally massively improved through clever refactoring.
Worth every second and a nice way to complete the day.

=== Day Three

==== Keynote

The themes are Java and AI.
Artificial intelligence is a hot topic with few concrete scenarios.
The three most cited areas are personal assistant, coding assistant, and image generator.

_A good coding copilot would be a great use case._
_Jetbrains and other companies solutions are still work in progress and often not released to the public._

And two talks about physics and quantum computing.

Brian Goetz presented the new features of Java 21.
An alluring idea was presented.
Library owners should follow a similar release strategy as Java.

- LTS releases are delivered every two years.
Once released, only security problems and bugs are corrected in the LTS releases.
- New features are only implemented for the current Java release.
Use the newest Java features.
You do not have to provide backward compatibility for older versions.
Your users can use your LTS release.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The idea is so cool.
I will advocate the approach and try it on my open-source projects.

You have only to support two versions of your library.
You can use old the cool new features in the newest version without stressing about backward compatibility.
====

==== Unlocking the Potential of Bits and Bytes: Reducing Data Footprint for Cost and Eco-Efficiency

Beginner introduction of byte encoding for the payload.

The speaker advocates the use of cheap raspberry boards to experiment.

Smaller data packages reduce energy consumption, network traffic, and surprisingly also latency.

{ref-protobuf} is a good compromise to encode payloads.
Hand coded structures are still factors more compact but require code to encode and decode the payload.

==== PostgreSQL, The Time-Series Database You Actually Want

The speaker shows a demonstration of time series in {ref-postgresql}.
Nice to learn the database supports the feature, and I missed concrete examples why should I use it.

==== Project Leyden

Brian Goetz explained the various mechanisms to speed startup time and increase performance.
In the end, Java programs should be more cloud-friendly.

Use AppCDS to improve the startup performance of your application.
It should be a standard step in your deployment before packaging your application into a Docker image.

[source,console]
----
java -XX:+AutoCreateSharedArchive -XX:SharedArchiveFile=tangly-os-archive.jsa  <1>
----

<1> Since JDK 19, the CDS archive file is created automatically as a dynamic archive if it is missing.
If the file exists, the JVM will use it.
CDS is active per default _-Xshare:auto_.

Ideally, some improvements shall be delivered with JDK 22.

==== Java at AWS: Lessons Learned from Upgrading and Modernizing a Massive JVM Codebase

Speakers presented the huge gains moving from JDK 8 to JDK 17.

They had a few regression cases when doing such a huge jump in versions.
The troubles were methods or classes no more accessible in the newer version.
Just read the log files; the encountered restriction always generates a log describing the problem.

Beware that more threads can be active in garbage collection in newer versions.

They provided an interesting argumentation why they will wait with the update to Java 21.
The known bugs are too critical to update such a huge installed base.

James Gosling was interesting and getting older.
He had a point that multiple libraries implementing the same functions are eating away your memory.
A Java application should have one JSON transformer, one serializer, and one HTTP protocol stack.

[TIP]
====
Limit the number of libraries you are using.

The biggest inhibitors for updates are test mocks and Lombok.

Instead of forking an open-source library, write a change request first.
Prefer pull requests over forks.
Sharing source code is more toxic than sharing binaries.
Long live maven central.
====

==== Java on Arm. New horizons

It was a boring presentation.
I know a little about ARM processor architecture.
The speaker just presented the different processors available on the market.

No real presentation how Java is optimized for ARM architecture.
He could have presented intrinsics, SIMD support and other architecture optimizations.

Cloud companies provide ARM-based solutions with tens or hundreds of cores.
All Apple computers are running on ARM.

One clear statement was we will run our applications on a platform with a lot of ARM or X86 cores in the future.

==== Coding Your Documentation

Hubert Klein also known as _mrhaki_ is an advocate of {ref-asciidoc}.
He has a cool https://blog.mrhaki.com/[blog].
I am also a fan of {ref-asciidoc}, {ref-asciidoctor}, and {ref-hugo}.

The presentation was interesting and professional.

[sidebar]
I am an absolute fan of {ref-asciidoc}, {ref-plantuml} and {ref-hugo}.
I enjoyed seeing how he solved similar problems with the same toolchains.

=== Day Four

*Surprise, Surprise*.
The public transportation went on strike today.
I had a nice stroll along the harbor to reach the conference venue.
The weather was fine and I achieved my daily sport quota.

In the evening, I discovered that the strike is going on.
I got my second walk and enjoyed the sunset over the harbor and the old city.

It was the first day with fall temperatures.
The previous days had summer temperatures.
You still could have dinner outside on a terrace.
It was a little chilly, but locals enjoyed the last warm days of this season.

==== Open Telemetry and Continuous Feedback. Things you need to know about your Java code at runtime

The speaker favors integration and production feedbacks how the application behaves.

He advocates {ref-opentelemetry} because it is an industrial standard.

[sidebar]
An introduction how to use {ref-opentelemetry} can be found under http://continuousfeedback.org/[Continuous Feedback].

The {ref-digma} plugin is an approach to support developers.
Observability metrics are provided during development and testing directly in your {ref-idea}.

Cool plugin providing developer functionality without having to install multiple docker images as with regular DevOps tools.

==== Lessons learned using Machine Learning in Java

Funny presentation how to classify Lego bricks using machine learning.

The speaker is not a machine learning _ML_ specialist and had a steep learning curve.
All packages are available as open source packages.

The Java ecosystem is smaller and less well documented.
He used {ref-djl}.

One important finding was _use real images, do not create them mechanically_.
The difference is tremendous.

[sidebar]
Tutorials how to set up a machine learning environment, train the models, and process application data are sorely missing.

[#awesome-speech-llm]
==== Java Meets AI: A Hands-On Guide to Building LLM-Powered Applications with LangChain4j

This presentation was the coolest of the whole Devoxx 2023.

The speaker is an active developer of {ref-langchain4j}.
Her approach solves the troubles described in the previous talk for LLM models.

[sidebar]
If you are a beginner, go to https://huggingface.co/[HuggingFace] and https://localai.io/[localAI].

The code examples show how little code you need to set up a chat agent backed with a LLM model.

You can define your own tools to compute values instead of asking the model to guess them.
Better than you can ask your model to generate a tool because models can also write source code.
This is awesome.

[sidebar]
I have to test chat with documents.
Train with your documents, for example, your blog.
After training, the chat can answer questions about your own documents or source code.

==== Debugging with IntelliJ IDEA

Solid presentation of {ref-idea} debugger features with hands-on examples.

I seldom use the debugger.
The tips were good but not really relevant for me.

==== gRPC Supercharged with Armeria

The speaker presented a solid introduction to {ref-grpc} and {ref-armeria}.

The frameworks provide needed services for a highly scalable applications based on microservices.
{ref-armeria} industrializes {ref-grpc} services.

The concepts are clean and well-implemented.
The decorator pattern is used to add functionality to services.
I seldom have non-functional requirements requiring such complex architectures.

[sidebar]
The {ref-armeria} framework provides the equivalent of {ref-openapi} for {ref-grpc}.
Beware that {ref-armeria} is a framework which again implemented an HTTP engine.

==== Building and Deploying Java Client Desktop Applications With JDK 21 and Beyond

A solid presentation about Swing and JavaFX.
You can use both libraries in the same application.

The demonstration of an email client was solid.
I got the impression that not a lot of innovations are happening in the Swing or JavaFX landscapes
footnote:[I do not care too much about the inertia.
I am mainly developing web-based applications with {ref-vaadin}.
{ref-jetbrains} is doing an incredible job to update Swing and Java 2D subsystems to changes.
The https://openjdk.org/projects/lanai/[Lanai] and https://openjdk.org/projects/wakefield/[Wakefield] projects are awesome.].

[sidebar]
Use _jpackage_ to create a native installer
footnote:[You can only create an installer for the platform where you are running _jpackage_.
Use a continuous delivery platform to build installer for all the platforms you want to support.].
For example, it creates a _dmg_ installer for the macOS platform.

==== Open standards for building event-driven applications in the cloud

The speaker provided a good introduction to {ref-asynapi} and {ref-cloudevents}.

[sidebar]
Funny to have a speaker at a Java conference stating he did not install Java on his notebook and showing C# examples.
It is a proof the speaker did not prepare for this talk.
It felt like disrespect to the conference attendees.

=== Day Five

The last conference day.
I am surprised how tiring it was to listen to so many presentations and trying to memorize interesting concepts.

I decided to leave earlier to be sure to catch my flight.
The yesterday experience with the strikes made me worried.
It worked well, and I was ahead on time at the airport.

[sidebar]
I decided to enjoy the digital nomad feeling.
I published this blog at the airport while waiting to board my plane.

==== The developer's guide to making money in the open-source galaxy

An entertaining presentation about entrepreneurship.

He had tribulations between Java and .NET projects.
I finally got the courage to realize a product idea I had long ago and implement it as an open-source Java.
{ref-jobrunr} was born as a port of .NET Hangfire.

He used redIT to market his product.
He enjoys working with the Java community and Java champions.
They are very supportive and kind.

The commercial model is {ref-jobrunr} as open-source application and a paid professional version.
The first license is a permanent license to a French company priced 400 EUR.

The breakthrough was a talk in May 2022 at the Spring I/O conference.
The ThoughtWorks technology radar mentioned {ref-jobrunr} and increased the exposure.

He made 90'000 EUR in 2022.
The forecast for 2023 is around 260'000 EUR.
This year is hired his first employee.

The whole approach is cute, hands-on, and most importantly working.
He is able to live from an open-source product.
This is an impressive and sadly seldom achievement.

==== The Panama Dojo: Black-Belt Programming with Java 21 and the FFM API

Per Minborg provided again a cool high-quality talk about {ref-panama and {ref-ffm}.

An arena models the lifecycle of one or more memory segments.
All segments allocated in the arena share the same lifetime.
Multiple arena types are provided for different scenarios.

Memory layouts describe contents of a memory region programmatically.

[sidebar]
With {ref-panama}, it is again good and easier to call C libraries from Java applications.
JNI is now officially an obsolete technology.
Use {ref-ffm} to call external libraries.

=== Learnings

Please use the *current* release of Java.
Most speakers rightly make fun of organizations still using Java 8 or older versions.
They seriously asked why you are not yet on the Java LTS 21 version.

Embrace *functional programming*.
Conquer streams and lambda expressions defined as pure functions.
Promote immutable objects and collections in your source code.
These design solutions naturally scale with more processing cores.

Advanced discussions were heard in some talks.
How should and would Java evolve in the next years?
Current https://openjdk.org/[openJDK] projects cover all ideas I heard during the conference.
The exception is how to support ML and AI approaches.
I am only aware of https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=381[JSR 381]
footnote:[I have the impression that JSR approach is dead.
Oracle architects stated the goal is to make Java a friendly environment for all important trends.
Project {ref-panama} is an approach to better integrate ML and AI libraries with Java.
{ref-panama} is available in curren Java versions.
Project {ref-valhalla} would allow more performant implementation of computation algorithms in Java.
It is a pity that we are still waiting on a fist release of the project.].

Green IT is regularly cited.
I am not sure organizations take the initiative seriously.

Speakers are professional engineers.
Almost all of them have Apple notebooks.
Professional Java developers are using {ref-idea} from {ref-jetbrains}.
More than 80% of conference participants use it.

I love the modern connected world.
I hold video conferences with my daughters and wife every day without trouble.

I was pleased that no customers called me during the conference.
