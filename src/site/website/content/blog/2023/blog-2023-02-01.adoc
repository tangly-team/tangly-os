=== What is Your Goal?

Your sole goal is to hire a qualified collaborator with potential.

=== Prepare Your Interview

You should be prepared for the interview.
You have read the CV of your candidate and visited her LinkedIn profile.

Expect a good candidate will also interview you to find out more about your organization and culture.
It is almost like a dating meeting.
Both parties shall have an opportunity to find out if we are a match.

=== Perform the Interview

I want to find out how the candidate performs tasks and interacts with his team.
I am very curious how he learnt new skills.
The area of interests are:

Coding::
How do you write source code?
What do you think about technical excellence cite:[clean-code,clean-coder,clean-craftsmanship,refactoring,refactoring-databases]
Software design and architecture::
How do you design your components?
Which techniques do you use for evolving your software architecture?
What do you think about design and architecture approaches cite:[design-patterns,clean-architecture,domain-driven-design,building-evolutionary-architectures]
What are your approaches with existing and legacy solutions cite:[working-effectively-with-legacy-code,refactoring]
Agile approaches::
What do you think about agile approaches cite:[clean-agile]
Teamwork, softskills, teaching and mentoring::
How do you teach and mentor team members? cite:[ing-technical-leader,skilled-facilitator,humble-inquiry]
Why do he wants to work in our company?::
Please elaborate.
Why is she a software engineer?::
Please tell us your story.

The areas are similar to the ones I check when receiving a CV <<evaluate-technical-cvs>>.

=== Write-down Your Findings and Recommendations

=== Have an onboarding Program

-> avoid checklist, avoid predeclared correct answers
-> aim to uncover reasons why you should hire a candidate
-> to not say: we want developers who can exchanged
-> you want to hire good people that can learn and improve
-> your organization should promote that people can learn and evolve
-> Be clear what you are looking for: make team better, bring new things, what do they value in code and architecture
-> how do they solve problems (architecture, design, process, code, bug)
-> open ended questions, to start a discussion
-> make criteria clear, if a criteria is not reached, inform them that you expect to reach the criteria
-> an interviewee should also interview the interviewers

-> complement with pair programming, pair design during probe time

=> always the best, no the free-es Voice, Screen-Sharing, Continuous Integration
