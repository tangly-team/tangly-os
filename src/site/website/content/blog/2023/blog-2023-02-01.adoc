Your sole goal is to hire a qualified collaborator with potential.

Hiring is like dating.

Both parties shall be motivated to deepen their relationship.

Both parties are willing to invest and believe it will be beneficial for them.

Dating also means you have competition.
Do your best to convince your potential partner.

It is worth investing time and effort to succeed.

=== Prepare Your Interview

You should be prepared for the interview.
You have read the CV of your candidate and visited her LinkedIn profile.

Expect a good candidate will also interview you to find out more about your organization and culture.
It is almost like a dating meeting.
Both parties shall have an opportunity to find out if we are a match.

Google provides hints how to work with creative software collaborators cite:[work-rules].

=== Perform the Interview

I want to find out how the candidate performs tasks and interacts with his team.
I am very curious how he learnt new skills.
The area of interests are:

Coding::
How do you write source code? +
What do you think about technical excellence cite:[clean-code,clean-coder,clean-craftsmanship,refactoring,refactoring-databases]?
Software design and architecture::
How do you design your components? +
Which techniques do you use for evolving your software architecture? +
What do you think about design and architecture approaches cite:[design-patterns,clean-architecture,domain-driven-design,building-evolutionary-architectures]? +
What are your approaches with existing and legacy solutions cite:[working-effectively-with-legacy-code,refactoring]?
Agile approaches::
What do you think about agile approaches cite:[clean-agile,clean-code,clean-architecture]
Teamwork, soft skills, teaching and mentoring::
How do you teach and mentor team members? cite:[being-technical-leader,skilled-facilitator,humble-inquiry]
Why does she want to work in our company?::
Please elaborate.
What do you find interesting about our company, our vision, and our products?
Why is she a software engineer?::
Please tell us your story. +
Being an engineer is also a passion. +
Professional engineers have ethics and are aware of their social responsibilities.

The areas are similar to the ones I check when receiving a CV <<evaluate-technical-cvs>>.

=== Write-down Your Findings and Recommendations

You should perform a technical interview with a colleague.
Try to write your impressions and findings using the same template for all candidates.

Compare your findings to diminish biases and misunderstandings.

=== Have an onboarding Program

- Avoid a checklist, avoid predeclared correct answers.
- Aim to uncover reasons why you should hire a candidate.
- Do not say: we want developers who can be exchanged.
- You want to hire good people that can learn and improve.
- Your organization should promote that people can learn and evolve.
- Be clear what you are looking for: make team better, bring new things, what do they value in code and architecture.
- How do they solve problems (architecture, design, process, code, bug)?
- Open-ended questions, to start a discussion.
- Make criteria clear, if a criteria is not reached, inform them that you expect to reach the criteria.
- An interviewee should also interview the interviewers.

A powerful technique is extensive pair programming and pair design in particular during probation time.
Your new collaborator leans how her team is working and the specifics of the product.
The team understands the strengths of the trainee.
They identify improvement areas to improve her effectiveness when working on the product.

Show your best as a modern development shop.
Your collaborators have access to 4K displays and professional keyboards, mice, headsets and desks
footnote:[I am regularly depressed that professional developers still do not have access to high-resolution displays or high-quality headsets.].

The employees are using state of the industry platform to create the products and to collaborate as teams
footnote:[I still encounter teams without tools like Slack.
Worst some still cannot use development platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket or Azure.].
