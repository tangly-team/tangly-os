Why is visibility so important in scrum / any agile team?

When you are running an Agile project, your ultimate goal is customer satisfaction with the delivered product.
However, the project coordination responsibilities are not limited to this.
The product owner shall nurture the vision, roadmap, and the release plan.
You must coordinate the workflow of your team, refine the product backlog, control identified riks, track deadlines, and complete additional tasks to complete the project.

=== Why Visual Tools?

Various practices exist to forecast progress, like burn-downs, burn-ups, or cumulative flows.
While proven useful, these do not replace the importance of empiricism.
In complex environments, what will happen is unknown.
Only what has already happened may be used for forward-looking decision making.

=== Scrum Visual Aids

Visibility ensures that the trust, reliability, and accountability exist in a team.

If your team, Scrum Master or Product Owner can’t see what you are doing, it creates the impression that you are doing lots of nothing!
Or doing lots of a lot of things completely wrong!
This is one of the fastest ways to find yourself in a quagmire of unfinished work.

Making your work visible raises expectation and luckily (if you really are working) it also raises opinions of you!

The time wasted extracting progress status out of a team-mate or following up on interdependent tasks WILL make you risk failing your sprint.
Working at a sustainable pace can only be achieved if you make proper use of the time available.

Your team and anyone else for that matter cannot trust someone who keeps his progress hidden.
They are in the dark (which leads to uncertainty), they tend to assume something is either being done or not being done and either get stuck into it themselves (or worse) they don’t do it….. So if you are not busy with it – well – it just does not get done!

How reliable you are depends on how transparent you are about what you have taken responsibility for and how much your team can trust you to handle it to completion without causing stress to the team.

Burn-down and burn-up diagrams The diagrams are available for sprints, epics, releases and products.
This is not a measure of work done but work which is STILL TO BE DONE.
It is a valuable tool to use as a thermometer or symptom checker.
Flatlining is a symptom of a few things – one of which is working on too many stories at a time – lots of nothing gets done very slowly.
Another is that tasks are not granular enough.
One of the things which we tried in the last sprint is not to accept any 6 hour tasks and on agreeing to decompose the 6 hour tasks further, one of them actually amounted to three more stickies which were in fact more than 6 hours in total (10 hours to be exact).
Because of its appealing visual format, your team members can understand this chart easily.
It is used to summarize a thorough description of a feature from an end-user perspective.
That is why you can update the chart only after the completion of a user story.

Sprint Burndown Chart::
The sprint burndown charts depict how much task is completed and how much remains in the ongoing sprints.
Sprint burndown chart displays user stories, which are selected by the team in the sprint planning session.
Product Burndown Chart::
Product burndown charts can visualize the entire project; in short, it looks at the big picture.
It shows how much work is remaining for your team to match the product goals.
The vertical axis displays the product backlog items in the product burndown chart, while the horizontal axis implies the sprint numbers.
Release Burndown Chart::
This burndown chart is responsible for tracking all the progress made by your scrum team during an iteration or product development.
The vertical axis of the chart depicts the hours or story points.
On the other hand, the horizontal axis represents the time your team members spent.
Cumulative flow diagrams::
The diagram are available for sprints, epics, releases and products.

Other diagrams are:

Velocity visualization::
Business can envision and calculate when they can potentially release a product or subset of a product based on how fast the team is working.  If the backlog has been estimated and grooming done properly, the number of story points it contains should be comparable to the velocity the team has been achieving sprint after sprint and an average velocity can be applied to the total number of story points in the backlog.  With this information the business can plan on a release date.

=== GitHub Tools

GitHub is a web development platform that is inspired by your work style.
It enables you to handle software development projects side-by-side with 40 million developers.

The main features are:

* The tool features built-in review options to host and review code.
* Integrate with apps you can find on GitHub Marketplace.
* Coordinate tasks, stay tuned, and optimize output whatever the size of the team.
* Write up comprehensive documents specifying all the awesome features of the software you develop.
* Store all your code in one place.
The platform with its 100+ million hosted projects provides repositories equipped with tools to help you host, version, and release private, public, or open-source code.

The updated projects functions better support agile approaches such as Scrum or Kanban.

Various addons are available for more complex diagrams and visualizations.
Start small, learn, and adapt your development tools.

=== Lessons Learnt

Visual aids to check the state of your product development support teams to take improvements as a daily activity
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDCA[PDCA] is easier to implement with realtime visual checks.

A picture is worth a thousand words.
The visualization of facts often help to identify improvement potential.
The same diagrams measure the success of specific improvement measures.
One well-documented successful approach are the four DORA metrics and associated graphs.
