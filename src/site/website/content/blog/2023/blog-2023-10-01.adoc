When you are running an Agile project, your ultimate goal is customer satisfaction with the delivered product.
However, the project coordination responsibilities are not limited to this.
The product owner shall nurture the vision, roadmap, and the release plan.
You must coordinate the workflow of your team, refine the product backlog, control identified riks, track deadlines, and complete additional tasks to complete the project.

=== Why Visual Tools?

Various practices exist to forecast progress, like burn-downs, burn-ups, or cumulative flows.
While proven useful, these do not replace the importance of empiricism.
In complex environments, what will happen is unknown.
Only what has already happened may be used for forward-looking decision making.
