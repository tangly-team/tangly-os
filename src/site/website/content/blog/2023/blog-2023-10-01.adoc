When you are running an Agile project, your ultimate goal is customer satisfaction with the delivered product.
However, the project coordination responsibilities are not limited to this.
The product owner shall nurture the vision, roadmap, and the release plan.
You must coordinate the workflow of your team, refine the product backlog, control identified riks, track deadlines, and complete additional tasks to complete the project.

=== Why Visual Tools?

Various practices exist to forecast progress, like burn-downs, burn-ups, or cumulative flows.
While proven useful, these do not replace the importance of empiricism.
In complex environments, what will happen is unknown.
Only what has already happened may be used for forward-looking decision making.

=== Scrum Visual Aids

Burn-down and burn-up diagrams The diagrams are available for sprints, epics, releases and products.
Burndown chart is a visual representation of a graph that assesses how much work a development team has done through a user story.
Because of its appealing visual format, your team members can understand this chart easily.
It is used to summarize a thorough description of a feature from an end-user perspective.
That is why you can update the chart only after the completion of a user story.
Sprint Burndown Chart::
The sprint burndown charts depict how much task is completed and how much remains in the ongoing sprints.
Sprint burndown chart displays user stories, which are selected by the team in the sprint planning session.
Product Burndown Chart::

=== Lessons Learnt

Visual aids to check the state of your product development support teams to take improvements as a daily activity
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDCA[PDCA] is easier to implement with realtime visual checks.

A picture is worth a thousand words.
