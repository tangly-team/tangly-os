Your organization heard of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps[DevOps] and your developers clamour you should adopt the approach.

Every customer organization I talk with has currently some DevOps initiative.
Often because they read that DevOps puts customer and end-user satisfaction at the center.

Does DevOps really improve the quality of your digital products and customer satisfaction?

Or is it only the next https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet[silver bullet] fad used to increase the bonus of consultants and managers?

=== What is DevOps?

Wikipedia provides the following definition
footnote:[The first conference dedicated to DevOps themes was held in 2009 in Ghent, Belgium.]:

[quote,Wikipedia]
____
*DevOps* is a set of practices that combines https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development[software development] *Dev* and
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IT_operations[IT operations] *Ops*.

It aims to shorten the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_development_life_cycle[system development life-cycle] and provide
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery[continuous delivery] with high https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_quality[software quality].

DevOps is *complementary* with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development[agile software development].
Several DevOps aspects came from the agile methodology.
____

DevOps is intended to be a cross-functional mode of working, practitioners use different toolchains rather than a single one.
These toolchains are expected to fit into one or more of the following categories, reflective of key aspects of the development and delivery process.

[NOTE]
====
Major product development platforms https://gitlab.com/[GitLab], https://github.com/[GitHub], or https://bitbucket.org/dashboard/overview[BitBucket] are classical examples of complete toolchains integration.
====

DevOps teams practice daily:

[horizontal]
Coding:: Code development and review, source code management tools, code merging.
Emphasize continuous development and testing.
Continuous testing can only be fully automated.
Building:: Continuous integration tools, build status.
Emphasize continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment.
Testing:: Continuous testing tools that provide quick and timely feedback on business risks.
Supports the continuous development activities.
Packaging:: Artifact repository, application pre-deployment staging.
Supports the continuous delivery activities in a corporate environment.
Releasing:: Change management, release approvals, release automation.
Supports the continuous delivery and deployment to productive servers.
Configuring:: Infrastructure configuration and management, infrastructure as code tools.
Supports the infrastructure as code approach.
Monitoring:: Applications performance monitoring, end-user experience.
Emphasize continuous monitoring and alarming, optimize time to recover metric.

=== Development

Development in an agile and DevOps environment means:

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration[Continuous integration], where the coding, building, integration, and testing processes are carried out.
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery[Continuous delivery], which includes continuous integration but mainly focuses on product delivery.
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_deployment[Continuous deployment], which aims at automating project deliveries.

The areas that a DevOps engineer must be competent are:

Version Control Systems::
Any DevOps engineer's has expertise in Git, and platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.
Infrastructure as Code _IaC_ is used to build and deploy digital products.
Documentation is always synchronized with the source artifacts.
Approaches such as static websites are preferred.
Continuous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD)::
As for this one, you should look for Jenkins, TeamCity, GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.
All products are build and packaged using continuous integration and continuous delivery approaches.
No manual steps are required to package a release for production.
It is important to note, however, that there are so many DevOps tools out there that it is impossible to cover them.
Testing and Automation Tools::
One of the duties of a DevOps engineer is to speed up the delivery of software to the clients.
Most companies care about the quality of their software and testing has become an essential part of DevOps engineers' job.
Functional and non-functional testing techniques and tools are used to guaranty quality of the installed solutions.
It provides the obvious benefits of automation, and also helps DevOps engineers save a lot of time.
Containers and Cloud Services::
Containers such as Docker and Kubernetes are used to deploy the digital solutions.
Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services are some examples.
Communication::
DevOps is not isolated to a specific role or to a specific team in your organization.
A DevOps specialist must have well-developed empathy because their job implies a lot of communication with other people.
Conflicts are not going to do them much good.
Deep understanding of empiricism and transparency of all available information and measurements is a must for successful communication in an agile and DevOps environment.

=== DevSecOps

Security and corporate governance awareness tremendously grew during the beginning of this decade.
Systematic cyberattacks and more stringent citizen protection laws displayed lack of competence in a lot of IT departments.

image::2022-04-04-DevOps-SecDevOps.png[width=420,height=360,role=left]

DevOps engineers shall always also be DevSecOps specialists and master:

Collective Responsibility::
Security is not something ephemeral whose progress and contribution cannot be measured.
Each person in the organization has their own security responsibility and must be aware of their own contribution to the organization's security stance.
Collaboration and Integration::
Security can only be achieved through collaboration, not confrontation.
Pragmatic Implementation::
They focus on application development to ensure safety, privacy and trust in the digital society.
Organizations shall be able to approach security in DevOps in a pragmatic manner.
Bridging the divide between Compliance and Development::
The key to addressing the gap between compliance and development is to identify applicable controls, translating them to appropriate software measures and identifying inflection points within the software lifecycle where these controls can be automated and measured.
Automation::
Software quality can be bettered by improving the thoroughness, timeliness and frequency of testing.
Processes that can be automated should be automated, and those that can't should be considered for elimination.
Measurement, Monitoring, Report and Action::
The results during software development as well as post-delivery must be continuously controlled by the qualified people at the right time for DevSecOps to succeed.

=== Minimal Capabilities

You are starting your journey with DevOps and you can at least provide following capabilities for all your teams and products:

Development::
* Each product can be checked out locally from a git repository and build with less than five commands.
* Each product can be build in a continuous delivery pipeline and packaged for deployment on a staging area or on production.
Static code analysis and automated tests are executed in the pipeline.
They provide an automated quality gate.
* Each production version is tagged in the repository including associated documentation and technical instructions.
Running:: Focus is on time to repair rather than time between issues
* Each instance has a monitoring feature enabled to provide realtime information about resource usage, heartbeat, health status and warnings.
* Each instance monitor view is accessible to all involved collaborators.
* Each deployed product has a set of targets and the associated metrics to track them.
* You have a documented process to handle security issues in a timely manner.
* You have a documented process to mitigate proactively potential security, performance and governance issues.
Empiricism and data are the building block to quality and sustainable improvements.
Continuous Improvement::
* Each product has a continuous improvement initiative.
The measures for the next releases are documented and progress is tracked.
* Each measure is regularly evaluated to adequacy and success.
Does the measure improve the overall quality of the product?
Do the actions measurably improve the associated metrics?

=== Checklist

. You give access to a product repository.
I can check out the whole project and build it locally with one command.
_I shall install the needed development tools based on written instruction available in the repository._
. You give access to a product repository.
I can initiate a full build and delivery in a continuous integration and delivery pipeline.
_I shall use the CI/CD tool chosen for the product._
. I can check out, build and deploy the two last releases on a staging area with less than ten commands.
. You give me access to the list of all issues and changes ongoing in the repository.
The list is specific to one product.
I see the information such as priority, cycle-time of these issues and in which release the issue was fixed.
. You give me read-only access to the health dashboard of any test and productive server on which the product run.
I see
* Uptime, availability, last down events with time of occurrence, duration, and explanation.
* Database, memory, CPU, etc. usage and trends,
* List of all alarms of involved components and resolution status.
. You give a list of improvements to continuously improve the quality of the product.
For each improvement a list of actions and their status is available.
. You automate everything.
All automation solutions are documented.
Manual configuration or installation are banned.

Microsoft has published a checklist for https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/checklist/dev-ops[Azure DevOps].

A vendor-agnostic checklist is https://devopschecklist.com/[the DevOps checklist].

=== Cultural change

DevOps initiatives create cultural changes in companies by transforming the way operations, developers, and testers collaborate during the development and delivery processes.
Getting these groups to work cohesively is a critical challenge in enterprise adoption.
DevOps is as much about culture, the toolchains are only instruments to implement the approach.

Organizational culture is a strong predictor of IT and organizational performance.
Cultural practices such as information flow, collaboration, shared responsibilities, learning from failures and encouraging new ideas are central to DevOps.

Team-building and other employee engagement activities are often used to create an environment that fosters this communication and cultural change within an organization.
DevOps as a service approach allows developers and operations teams to take greater control of their applications and infrastructure without hindering speed.
It also transfers the onus of owning a problem on to the development team, making them much more careful in their stride.

The 2015 State of DevOps Report discovered that the top seven measures with the strongest correlation to organizational culture and successful DevOps are:

. Organizational investment,
. Team leaders' experience and effectiveness,
. Continuous delivery,
. The ability of different disciplines _development, operations, and security_ to achieve win-win outcomes,
. Organizational performance,
. Deployment pain,
. Lean management practices.

=== Lessons Learnt

DevOps will only be successful if your organization adopt agile values.

Support transparency, inspection and adaption.
These concepts are central to empiricism and lean thinking.
Nurture commitment, focus, openness, respect and courage.
These are the official values of {ref-scrum}.

Be honest with yourself.

If you do not have concrete and visible initiatives in the areas of development _Dev_, running _Ops_ and continuous improvement, you are just pretending to be a professional.
But in reality you are just an amateur.
