The majority of software product development initiatives uses an agile approach.
It is natural that organizations would gravitate towards the many benefits agile realizes.

The outsourcing market is undergoing constant evolution.
Traditionally, cost reduction was the key driver for software development outsourcing, but now it doesn't even make the top five, according to Deloitte's 2018 Global Outsourcing Survey.

Instead, the top five reasons organizations opt for IT outsourcing are:

* Catalyst for innovation (64%)
* Improvement of speed and time to market (63%)
* Improvement of performance (54%)
* Enhancement of scalability and rapid elasticity (54%)
* Access to new tech (51%)

Communication is essential to agile software development.
And not just any form of communication.
It has to be in real-time.
Your team needs to have access to you, and vice versa, throughout the workday so that you can work through issues immediately.

=== Nearshore advantages

Geographical and Cultural Proximity::
Nearshore locations are located in or near Europe, making it easy to reach from most European cities via air connectio As a European nation.
We share the same mentality, values, and business culture as our clients.
It provides an excellent foundation for a long-lasting and productive nearshore partnership.
Convenient time zone and no jet lag::
A time difference of zero to two hours between nearshore locations and EU countries allows for setting up convenient cooperation.
It avoids exhausting jet lag.
Software engineers can engage with our clients during their business hours, maximizing efficiency while enhancing productivity.
Intellectual property protection::
European security and privacy requirements such as those imposed by ISO, GDPR, PCI, and HIPAA are understood.
Compliance with European legislation can be achieved.

=== Risks

Language::
All documents and comments in the source code shall legible for all team members.
Discussions and remote conference shall be held in a language availabe to all members.
A shoring strategy implicates that this language must International English.
All documents, emails, and chats must be written in English
Cultural Barriers::
The shored team collaborators shall be integrated in the company as respected and valuable colleagues.
Avoid any statements containing _we versus they_.
Meeting times should be good for all participants.
Location of documents, source code, and artifacts should have the same availability and comfort for all members.
Company Binding::
Effort must be put in the integration of the nearshore teams.
Churn-rates can be as high as 30% per year.
Agile Approaches::
The various departments and locations should have similar approaches to agile frameworks and processes.
A good solution is to standardize on {ref-scrum}.
Train and certify all collaborations in {ref-scrum} and your technology stack to create common ground and vocabulary.
