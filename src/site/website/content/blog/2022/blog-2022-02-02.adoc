The majority of software product development initiatives uses an agile approach.
The most popular framework is currently {ref-scrum}.

It is natural that organizations would gravitate towards the many benefits agile ideas provides.

Scarce resources and time-to-market constraints have driven the implementation of shoring development initiatives.
Awareness that talent can be found at any location speed-up the trend.

The outsourcing market is undergoing constant evolution.
Traditionally, cost reduction was the key driver for software development outsourcing, but now it doesn't even make the top five, according to
https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/process-and-operations/us-cons-global-outsourcing-survey.pdf[Deloitte's 2018 Global Outsourcing
Survey].

CAUTION: Cost was back as the major driver in 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic had a huge impact in 2020.

Instead, the top five reasons organizations opt for IT outsourcing in 2018 are:

* Catalyst for innovation (64%) _means internal department cannot innovate fast enough_
* Improvement of speed and time to market (63%) _means internal teams are slow_
* Improvement of performance (54%) _means company does not perform_
* Enhancement of scalability and rapid elasticity (54%) _means organization is slow to react_
* Access to new technology (51%) _means company is stuck with obsolete technologies and processes_

The top five reasons organizations opt for IT outsourcing in 2020 are:

* Cost (70%)
* Flexibility (40%)
* Speed to market (20%)
* Access to professional tools and processes (15%)
* Agility (15%)

Communication is essential to successfully implement agile software development.
And not just any form of communication.
It has to be in real-time.
Your team needs to have access to you, and vice versa, throughout the workday so that you and your team can work through issues immediately.

An agile shoring approach can be very successful.

Your organization needs to take the transformation seriously.
You must invest in cultural changes and adapt your processes to realize the full potential.

=== Nearshore advantages

Geographical and Cultural Proximity::
Nearshore locations are located in or near Europe, making it easy to reach from most European cities via air connection As a European nation.
We share the same mentality, values, and business culture as our clients.
It provides an excellent foundation for a long-lasting and productive nearshore partnership.
Convenient time zone and no jet lag::
A time difference of zero to two hours between nearshore locations and EU countries allows for setting up convenient cooperation.
It avoids exhausting jet lag.
Software engineers can engage with our clients during their business hours, maximizing efficiency while enhancing productivity.
Intellectual property protection::
European security and privacy requirements such as those imposed by ISO, GDPR, PCI, and HIPAA are understood.
Compliance with European legislation can be achieved.

=== Risks

Language::
All documents and comments in the source code shall be legible for all team members.
Discussions and remote conference shall be held in a language available to all members. +
A shoring strategy implies this language must be International English.
All documents, emails, and chats must therefore be written in English.
Your organization has to recognize this profound change and train all your collaborators to become fluent in written and spoken English.
Cultural Barriers::
The shored team collaborators shall be integrated in the company as respected and valuable colleagues.
Avoid any statements containing _we versus they_. +
Meeting times should be good for all participants.
Location of documents, source code, and artifacts should have the same availability and comfort for all members.
Company Binding::
Effort must be put in the integration of the nearshore teams.
Churn-rates can be as high as 50% per year.
Capabilities::
Talent is a precious resource.
Companies are fighting to acquire talented developers all over the world.
You should have a clear strategy to acquire and retain talented engineers.
The strategy should blend together why you are actractive for talents and why they should stay in your organization.
Agile Approaches::
The various departments and locations should have similar approaches to agile frameworks and processes.
A good solution is to standardize on {ref-scrum}.
Train and certify all collaborations in {ref-scrum} and your technology stack to create common ground and vocabulary.

=== Checklist

Ask yourself if your company culture and processes treat all collaborators fairly.
Is our company willing to:

. Write all project documentation, source code, emails, and chats in English?
. Hold all meetings, workshops and discussions in English?
. Train all collaborators in cultural aspects?
. Host physical meetings using round-robin on all locations?
. Schedule all meetings so that all locations have similar constraints for early or late work?
. Share financial and strategic information to align all collaborators?
. Set up the infrastructure to not differentiate between company offices and nearshore locations?
. Buy all licenses so that all developers are using the same tools?
. Provide the same trainings, certifications and conference access to all developers?
. Support meritocracy?
Any role can be held by a local or a remote collaborator?
