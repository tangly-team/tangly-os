=== Try with Closeable Resources

Automatic resource management was introduced in Java 7 in 2011.
Better handling of final variables was added in Java 9 in 2017.

The _AutoCloseable_ interface is the API extension you should use to declare any resource type in your solution.

=== Streams

Use streams to manipulate data collections.
Stream operators support similar functionality as SQL dialects.

Sequences of values are also streams. Therefore, a for loop is easily transformed in a stream of operations.

[IMPORTANT]
====

Most of imperative operations such as conditional and loop statements can be rewritten as streams.

Streams are often more legible and compact.
The approach moves the developers from imperative programming to a more functional programming style.

Modern Java code has seldom loops and conditional statements.
