=== SODA Hybrid Method

SoDa _Software Development Agile_ is a homebrew project development method created at the https://www.hslu.ch[technical university of Lucerne].
It is a mixture of Waterfall, RUP and Scrum. It uses a distorted Scrum for the concept and implementation phase.

A similar approach also exists with the official governmental Swiss project method {ref-hermes}.
At least the documentation of https://www.hermes.admin.ch/en/starting-page.html[Hermes] is better than SoDa.

Both approaches are quite similar.
They mix a phase based Waterfall approach with the four phases of the old https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_Unified_Process[RUP] project life-cycle approach.
RUP belongs to the family of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Process[unified process methods].

These approaches are obsolete.
Almost no industrial of services companies are explicitly using Waterfall or unified process approaches.

[quote, Malcom Isaacs]
____
For most of these organizations that take a hybrid approach, this is an interim step.
They intend to gradually expand their agile activities beyond the development and testing stages to the rest of the software development lifecycle.

=== HERMES Swiss Hybrid Method

If you are forced to use a hybrid method in Switzerland, please use Hermes. Never try to use SoDa.
It is obsolete and sparingly documented.

If you want to be a professional developer, please use an agile approach.
Scrum is currently the most used agile approach in the industry.

[quote,Hermes FAQ]
____
HERMES 2021
footnote:[ https://www.hermes.admin.ch/de/faq/projektmanagement-2021/umfeld.html[Hermes FAQ]]corresponds to the current requirements of the administrations, which are mainly organized *hierarchically* and have to handle projects taking governance into account.
____

The major problem is that Hermes is mandatory for a set of governmental projects.
You are forced to use this method as a software company if you want to work on some government initiatives.

The method is Swiss and completely unknown in Europe or abroad.
Industry development initiatives never use Hermes as a development approach.

=== Why Hybrid Methods are Hindering

In his mind-expanding book The Beginning of Infinity, physicist David Deutsch describes science and the enlightenment as the quest for _good explanations_.
He explains how various ideas in human history represent a _beginning of infinity_ that allow us to cope with any conceivable relevant application of these good explanations.

This idea of infinite reach or scope is true of an agile approach to development and not true of a waterfall-based approach.

An agile approach to software development actively encourages us to start work on solving problems in smaller pieces.
It encourages us to begin work before we know the answer to everything.
This approach allows us to make progress, maybe sometimes in suboptimal or even bad directions, but nevertheless, after each step, we learn something new.

This does not mean that agile thinking is perfect or the final answer.
Rather, it is an important, significant, enabling step in the direction of better performance.

=== Lessons Learnt

If you have choice do not use any hybrid method.
Various studies found out that agile initiatives are three times more successful than Waterfall approaches.

Business agility is not compatible with hybrid approaches.

The majority of hybrid methods I still encounter are bad rehearsal of the RUP development approach.
The unified process was defined in the nineties and is now obsolete.
