https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design[Domain Driven Development] is now the preferred software architecture approach for designing new products.
The method matches nicely with the concepts of micro-services.
Literature describes the approach and key concepts defining the development method.

The theory and examples are quite sparse how to structure your code.
How should you structure your namespaces and modules?

We propose a simple and adequate code structure for implementation in modern Java.
The approach builds on the strengths of the Java packages and modules.
The visibility rules of the language are used to enforce cohesion and minimize coupling.

The described approach is ideal for small to medium software solutions.
The source code size of a bounded domain is less than 50'000 lines of code.

[cite,Eric Evans,Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software]
____
The heart of software is its ability to solve domain-related problems for its user.
____

=== Layers in DDD

Domain driven design _DDD_ has four layers in the architecture:

Interface::
This layer is in charge of the interaction with user, whether software presents information or receives information from user.
Application::
This is a thin layer between interface and domain, it could call domain services to serve the application purposes.
Domain::
The heart of the software, this layer holds domain logic and business knowledge.
Infrastructure::
A supporting layer for the other layers.
This layer contains supporting libraries or external services like database or UI supporting library.

=== Package Structure

A bounded domain shall be configured as a Java module.
The exported services and entities are explicitly listed with the _exports_ directive.
A huge advantage is the obligation to list all dependencies with the _requires_ directive.

Services::
defines the bounded domain context.
The domain uses the library to implement a bounded domain.
The ports, handler and realm are declared in the context package for small bounded domains.
Complex domains can declare these interfaces in separate packages for legibility.
Logic::
contains common business logic and features.
Elaborate domains can contain quite a few business features.
Use a package structure increasing legibility and enforcing separation of concerns.
Ports:::
contains the services receiving data and events from the environment.
Handlers:::
contains the services providing data and events to the environment and to other applications.
Realm:::
contains the repository functions to persist and create domain entities and object values.
The current approach uses the https://microstream.one/[MicroStream] approach.
The amount of code to persist the domain model is minimal.
Domain::
contains the abstraction describing the bounded domain.
Care is taken to define resilient and legible domain abstractions.

}

The infrastructure support classes are not part of this structure.
These classes shall be defined in a separate Java module and imported with regular dependency declaration.

We use the https://www.archunit.org/[ArchUnit] tool to insure the expected structure is provided for each bounded domain.

The user interface for a bounded domain is stored in separate package and often in its own Java module.
The bounded domain implementation shall not constrain the technologies used to provide a user interface.
Different approaches for user interface realization are available and no clear winner can currently be identified.

I use mainly https://www.vaadin.com[Vaadin] to realize browser or mobile first internal applications.

=== Java Considerations

Entities shall have a well-documented internal or external identifiers.
Entities visible to other bounded domain shall always have an external identifier.
Identifiers are always immutable objects.

[cite,Martin Fowler]
____
Objects that have a distinct identity that runs through time and different representations.
You also hear these called _reference objects_.
____

Value objects shall be expressed as Java value types.
Record construct is the preferred way to model a value object in Java.
The record concept provides the expected _equals(Object)_ behavior.

[cite,Martin Fowler]
____
Objects that matter only as the combination of their attributes.
Two value objects with the same values for all their attributes are considered equal.
____

An aggregate is a set of Entities and Value Objects that do not make sense alone.
Every aggregate has a root entity, which will be responsible for providing all methods involving business rules that will modify its child entities.
The first rule is that aggregates reference each other by identity instead of object references.
Aggregates shall be constructed with the help of factory patterns such as factory method, abstract factory, or builder.

[cite,Martin Fowler]
____
A DDD aggregate is a cluster of domain objects that can be treated as a single unit.
An example may be an order and its line-items, these will be separate objects.
Tt is useful to treat the order together with its line items as a single aggregate.
____

Rich domains are models that have full control of their data and do not rely on external objects to manipulate them.
Anemic domains are models that rely on other classes to validate their data.
Anemic domains are a smell in the domain driven design world.

Services should be pure functions and be stateless.

[cite]
____
Pure functions are functions (or methods) that do not change the value of any object outside it.
It avoids side effects and guaranteeing the same output for certain inputs, ie it needs to be completely deterministic.
____

=== Architecture Integrity

A Bounded Context is a logical boundary of a domain where particular terms and rules apply consistently.
Inside this boundary, all terms, definitions, and concepts form the Ubiquitous Language.

The Java Platform Module System (JPMS) encourages to build more reliable and strongly encapsulated modules.
As a result, these features can help to isolate our contexts and establish clear boundaries.

A bounded domain is implemented as a Java module.

The domain internal layered architecture is verified with https://www.archunit.org/[ArchUnit] custom validation rules.
The rules are coded as unit tests and are processed in the continuous integration pipeline.

The advantages of the architecture are

* The whole company talking the same ubiquitous language, reduced risk of misunderstandings.
Everyone needs to be aligned, both in vocabulary and ownership of the components.
The engineers have a common understanding and coding guidelines to realize the layers inside a bounded domain.
* You have a segregated architecture defining a modular monolith application.
* Smaller and well-defined components are easier to maintain.
Your services are independent and can more easily be refactored.
* Development scalability is implicitly provided.
Teams can develop simulaneoulsy and independantly bounded domain features.

=== Bounded Domain Releations

There are five main types of relationships between Bounded Contexts:

Partnership::
a relationship between two contexts that cooperate to align the two teams with dependent goals
Shared Kernel::
a kind of relationship when common parts of several contexts are extracted to another context/module to reduce code duplication
Customer-supplier::
a connection between two contexts, where one context (upstream) produces data, and the other (downstream) consume it.
In this relationship, both sides are interested in establishing the best possible communication
Conformist::
this relationship also has upstream and downstream, however, downstream always conforms to the upstreamâ€™s APIs
Anti-corruption layer::
this type of relationship is widely used for legacy systems to adapt them to a new architecture and gradually migrate from the legacy codebase.
The protection layer acts as an adapter to translate data from the upstream and protect from undesired changes

=== Lessons Learnt

Great technologies, programming languages and tools are used when building software appliations.
That is good and right.
But unfortunately it is often lost that the decisive factor for the success of a project is not the technology, but the solution.
In order to be able to understand the subject matter or domain, we need a common language with the domain experts and users.
If we do not map the technical model in the software and its architecture, it will not help our users in their work.
As a computer scientist, it is easy to fall into the trap of focusing on technology instead of specialist knowledge
footnoote:[In the modern trend of technology driven curriculum this dreadful approach is often encountered].
The principle of bounded contexts from DDD can help us here.

[cite,Stefan Tilkov,2021]
____
Domain-driven design (DDD) is a useful approach that provides excellent guidelines for modeling and building systems, but it is a means to an end, not an end in itself.
While the concepts are valid, you lose a lot if you limit yourself to using them only: There actually is a life beyond DDD.
