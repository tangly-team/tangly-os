In an increasingly technology-focused world, the demand for businesses to digitize has grown dramatically.

So, what does it mean to digitize your business?

Essentially, it means incorporating technology into your business operations to increase efficiency, enhance customer experience, and boost sales.

This could mean developing a mobile application for your startup, transitioning into ecommerce, offering mobile payment options, and more.

The goal of digitizing your business is to keep up with the rapidly changing economy by offering your customers more ways to access your business, and streamline daily operations.
Therefore, the methods you choose to digitize your business can vary based on your startupâ€™s needs.

Start small.
Optimize your internal process with technology.
I challenge you.

Your company does not need any printers, fax machines or landlines.

=== Eliminate Your Printer

You do not need a printer in your company.
Send your documents as PDF documents.
Archive the PDF electronically.

Printers are not ecological and have a price tag.

[TIP]
====
Our company {ref-tangly} never possessed any printer, fax machine or phone landlines.

On average, we need to print three documents per year.
These documents were always required by governmental authorities.

We did not print any documents in the years 2021 and 2022.
====

=== Fax Machines are obsolete

I cannot understand why anybody wants to send information using a fax machine.

Electronic communication, PDF documents and digital photography are better solutions.

=== Landlines were used in the last millennium

Teams are distributed over the world.
Collaborators often work at home or at co-working offices.
Why should you use a landline?

Mobile first is the answer.
Use a mobile phone for your work interactions.
Better is to setup channels on Slack or Discord applications.

=== Eliminate Your Paper Archive

I always found very strange that people print their documents and store them in cabinets.

They never heard about digital backup with redundancy to avoid loss through incidents.
Store your files in the cloud to implement a disaster recovery process.

Naturally, all confidential information shall be encrypted with a company key.
We are using GPG as a simple and secure approach to hide confidential information from prying eyes.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You can exchange documents and emails securely with collaborators and customers using GPG and S/Mime solutions.

{ref-tangly} uses MacOS and we bought the GPG email extension to sign and cipher all communication.
The S/Mime based approach is also available.

=== Lessons Learnt

- Printers and fax machines are really obsolete.
We never add a true need to buy one in the last eight years.
- A paper archive can now slowly be destroyed.
Finally the federal and state laws were adapted to acknowledge that digital archives are legally allowed.
- We never had any landline.
Mobile phones are now fully accepted since telecommunication companies offer flat rate contracts.
More and more communication is now held over internet communication solutions.
- All contracts and invoices

The support of FacturX for B2G processes was around two days effort.]
are sent as electronic signed PDF documents.
- Native digital persons often do not anymore possess paper books, CD, or printed photos.
Instead they use the digital equivalent.
It is more ecological, cost-effective and is additional features.
- Physical money has disapeard in the context of companies.
All financial transactions are electronic.
