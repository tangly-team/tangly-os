Domain-Driven Design (DDD) has been around since Eric Evans published his book about the subject in 2003.

BDD inversion - acceptance criteria are coded as acceptance test and documentation is automatically generated Acceptance criteria are discussed with the product owner and users Developer writes the acceptance tests and generates automatically legible description of the tests The product owner can accept the story based on the test description enforcing his acceptance criteriaBou

Rich Domains are models that have full control of their data and do not rely on external objects to manipulate them.
Anemic Domains are models that rely on other classes to validate their data.

I want to keep the understanding of the strategies simple.
The Domain Events strategy is nothing more than an event fired from a Context X microservice with information that may interest other contexts.

This strategy is used when we would like to have asynchronous behavior between our contexts, since the context responsible for publishing the message will not expect a return.
For instance, the action that the consumer will take based on this event does not matter to him.
For it is always important to think about notifying past actions.
