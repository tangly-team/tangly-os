BDD inversion - acceptance criteria are coded as acceptance test and documentation is automatically generated
Acceptance criteria are discussed with the product owner and users
Developer writes the acceptance tests and generates automatically legible description of the tests
The product owner can accept the story based on the test description enforcing his acceptance criteria
