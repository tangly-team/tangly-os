Professional software developers shall master their primary technology stack and programming language.
I am a proficient and experienced programmer in Java.
I have written production code in Java for the last twenty years.
I decided to study the language in depth and acquired various Java developer certifications.
And I love the language and environment.

I want to understand the strengths and weaknesses of Java as well.
A good approach is to learn more about Groovy and Clojure.
I want to understand various strenghts in different languages.
One major focus is functional programming approaches and hwo they impact design and development activities.

=== Clojure

Clojure is the functional programming language and a Lisp(1) dialect.
The language compiles to and runs on the JVM and interfaces to Java and API libraries.

[quote,Alan J. Perlis]
____
It is better to have 100 functions operate on one data structure than to have 10 functions operate on 10 data structures.
____

Clojure is a Lisp dialect not constrained by backward compatibility.

* Extends the code-as-data paradigm to maps and vectors
* Defaults to immutability
* Core data structures are extensible abstractions
* Embraces the JVM platform

==== Expressions and Statements

[source,clojure]
----
(def <name> <value>)
(if (<condition>) (<true-expression>) (<false-expression)) ;; else is optional
(when (<condition>) (<true-expression>))
(cond
  (<condition-1) (expression-1)
  (condition-2) (expression-2)
  :else (expression-else))
(case <value>
 <value-1> <expression>
 <value-2> <expression>
 <expression-else>)
(loop [] (expression-loop))
(do {expression})
----

Number tower
Truth

==== Functions and Closures

Functions are a key construct for a functional language.
You can define functions and closures using:

defn, fn,  let, letn

===== Higher-order Functions and Sequences

Sequence abstraction permeates the design and API of Clojure.
Functional programming emphasizes the design of functions working on generic data structures.

===== Recursion, Tail Recursion, Currying, Memoization

loop
recur
partial
memoize

==== Functions and Lambdas

You can define functions and lambdas using:

===== Higher-order Functions and Streams

===== Recursion, Tail Recursion, Currying, Memoization
