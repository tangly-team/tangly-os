=== Minimize Boilerplate Code

Lombok

Deploy as an executable application. You do not need an application server.

Package the whole application in a docker image for integration and testing activities.

=== Lightweight Database

hsqldb
schema per domain
schema.sql and data.sql
Views for read-only objects
Business logic should be in services


=== Fluent Getter and Setter

Spring Persistence and JPA
Extends persistence to support Java abstractions such as enumeration sets

Use record construct for immutable entities

Configure Jackson

=== Eliminate DTO

JSON objects are your data transfer objects
JSON schema define the data model and validate it
Use annotation to remove AOT artifacts generated through JPA enhancements.
Use annotation to coerce Jackson to not request old fashion property getters and setters.
Configure Jackson to support records

=== Schedulers in Spring

Easy to use

=== User Interface

Use Vaadin for internal applications and B2B applications

Use Thymeleaf and Bootstrap for B2C applications

Use AngularJS or VueJS if you have a lot of budget

=== Test Driven Development
