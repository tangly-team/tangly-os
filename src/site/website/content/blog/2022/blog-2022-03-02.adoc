In the midst of this agile explosion, many teams are experiencing difficulties.
According to the
https://stateofagile.com/[15th Annual State of Agile report], 46% of survey respondents report struggles with inconsistent practices and 43% report cultural classes.

=== Common Symptoms

Below are some common symptoms of teams who are “pretending” to be agile:

* Teams are not delivering a _done_, usable increment each Sprint.
By usable we mean that the product is fully tested and provides a fully usable increment of valuable functionality.
* The Daily Scrum is a status update instead of a mini planning session.
* The Sprint Review meeting is merely a demo, and not an opportunity for collaboration.
* The Sprint Retrospective does not result in actionable improvement ideas that the Scrum Team addresses proactively.
* The quality of the product resulting from the Scrum Team’s work is not increasing.
* The Scrum Master is not coaching the Scrum Team or the parent organization in techniques to improve the use of the Scrum framework.
* Developers don’t self-manage or collaborate with the Product Owner on ways to maximize the product’s value.
* The organization does not respect the Product Owner’s decisions.
* Resource managers do not know how to support agile teams.

=== Dark Agile

The problem is when a team begins to use an Agile framework incorrectly.
The team begins to focus more on their adherence to the process than they do to staying true to Agile values.
This is Dark Agile.
The team presents itself as Agile and believes it is practicing Agile, but it is not.
It is practicing a framework without the support of Agile values.
This can lead to micromanagement, a squashing of adaptability toward customers’ changing needs, and an extreme lessening of the benefits gained from an Agile practice.
