How often have you experienced a well-defined and understood software architecture on paper.
But then it falls apart when developers start implementing it?

Recently, while re-architecting legacy components in an application, I experienced the same.
As more and more developers joined the team, it became a constant routine to make them aware of the design and how to adhere to it.

I know some of you may say, "Why not control the implementation during code-review?".
Well technically you can, but in that case, the reviewer becomes the bottleneck in the whole SDLC process.

What if there was something that could enforce the design constraint in the form of the test cases?
The violation of the agreed-upon design principles are marked as failed build.

My quest led me to a test library called https://www.archunit.org/[ArchUnit].

=== Idea

ArchUnit is a test library that allows us to validate whether an application adheres to a given set of design consideration or architecture rules.
The product is a free, simple and extensible library for checking the architecture of your Java code using any plain Java unit test framework.
That is, ArchUnit can check dependencies between packages and classes, layers and slices, check for cyclic dependencies and more.
It does so by analyzing given Java bytecode, importing all classes into a Java code structure.

=== Used Constraints

Checking existence of cyclic dependencies in the code
Enforcing Layered or Onion architecture

=== How to use?
