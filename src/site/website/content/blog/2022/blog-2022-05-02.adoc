Software development topics I have become to like after 40 years in the industry.

=== Strongly Agree

* Typed languages are better when you're working on a team of people with various experience levels
* Standups are actually useful for keeping an eye on the newbies.
* Sprint retrospectives have their place so long as they're for actual course correction (i.e. _holy shit, well that went poorly!_) and not some god awful scrum master driven waste of everyone's time
* Developers shouldn't be isolated or left to just code.
Bypassing TPMs, PMs, and talking directly to the customer always reveals more about the problem, in less time, and with higher accuracy
* Software architecture matters probably more than anything else.
A shitty implementation of a good abstraction causes no net harm to the code base.
A bad abstraction or missing layer causes everything to rot.
* Java is quite a cool language.
* clever code isn't usually good code.
Clarity trumps all other concerns.
* Bad code can be written in any paradigm
* So called "best practices" are contextual and not broadly applicable.
Blindly following them makes you an idiot
* Designing scalable systems when you don't need to makes you a bad engineer.
* Static analysis is actually useful
* DRY is about avoiding a specific problem, not an end goal unto itself.
* In general, RDBMS > NoSql
* Functional programming is another tool, not a panacea.

=== Possitive Experience

* YAGNI, SOLID, DRY.
In that order.
* Pencil and paper are the best programming tools and vastly under used
* Trading purity in exchange for practicality is usually a good call
* Adding more technology in response to a minor problem is rarely a good call.
* Design is driven from requirements.
Building anything beyond those requirements puts you into the world of speculative, self-indulgent invention.
* 90%, maybe 95%, of project managers, could probably disappear tomorrow to either no effect or a net gain in efficiency.
* After performing over 2000 interviews, I can say that standard human resources interviewing is thoroughly broken.
Technical interviewing and peer interviewing work way better and is more accurate.

=== Old Beliefs

* A software developer shall have formal training in computer science and software engineering.
She should held at least a bachelor degree.
* A junior Java developer shall pursue a formal Java programmer certification.
The learning effect is not always huge but as a team member I have security that all basic concepts are known.
* People who stress over code style, linting rules, or other minutia are insane weirdos
* Code coverage has absolutely nothing to do with code quality
* Monoliths are pretty good in most circumstances
* Micro-services require justification
