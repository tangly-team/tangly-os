Historically, big beat small.
Scale was a sufficient advantage.
Now, fast and adaptive beats slow and steadfast.
New technologies, evolving customer preferences and changing employee expectations are fundamentally challenging established ways of working.
It’s time to move beyond a rigid hierarchy, siloed business units, crippling bureaucracy and an increasingly unwieldy matrix.
Agile organizations combine the efficiencies of scale with the speed, flexibility and resilience to compete and win in today’s world.

[quote, Gunther Verheyen]

Increasing agility is a path. Progressing on that path requires vision, belief, persistence and… hard work.

Companies are asking:

* Why does our organization struggle to move quickly and what can we do about it?
* How do we empower our people to take more accountability for performance and truly embed customer centricity?
* How do we organize for both sides of the productivity equation—cost and innovation-driven growth?

=== Challenges of Agile Companies

Now, we find the machine paradigm shifting in the face of the organizational challenges brought by the “digital revolution” that is transforming industries, economies, and societies.
This is expressed in four current trends:

Quickly evolving environment::
All stakeholders’ demand patterns are evolving rapidly: customers, partners, and regulators have pressing needs; investors are demanding growth, which results in acquisitions and restructuring; and competitors and collaborators demand action to accommodate fast-changing priorities.
Constant introduction of disruptive technology::
Established businesses and industries are being commoditized or replaced through digitization, bioscience advancements, the innovative use of new models, and automation.
Examples include developments such as machine learning, the Internet of Things, and robotics.
Accelerating digitization and democratization of information::
The increased volume, transparency, and distribution of information require organizations to rapidly engage in multidirectional communication and complex collaboration with customers, partners, and colleagues.
The new war for talent::
As creative knowledge- and learning-based tasks become more important, organizations need a distinctive value proposition to acquire—and retain—the best talent, which is often more diverse.
These “learning workers” often have more diverse origins, thoughts, composition, and experience and may have different desires (for example, millennials).
