Historically, big beats small.
Scale was a sufficient advantage to be successful in the market.

Now, fast and adaptive beats slow and steadfast.

New technologies, evolving customer preferences and changing employee expectations are fundamentally challenging established ways of working
footnote:[The impact of the last pandemic on home office, remote distributed teams, and hybrid company models was tremendous and here to stay.].

It is time to move beyond rigid hierarchies, siloed business units, crippling bureaucracy, and an increasingly unwieldy matrix.
--

Agile organizations combine the efficiencies of scale with the speed, flexibility, and resilience to compete and win in today’s world.

[quote,Gunther Verheyen]
____
Increasing agility is a path.

Progressing on that path requires vision, belief, persistence, and _hard work_.
____

Companies are asking themselves:

* Why does our organization struggle to move quickly and what can we do about it?
* How do we empower our people to take more accountability for performance and truly embed customer centricity?
* How do we organize for both sides of the productivity equation—cost and innovation-driven growth?

== Challenges of Agile Companies

Now, we find the machine paradigm shifting in the face of the organizational challenges brought by the _digital revolution_ that is transforming industries, economies, and societies.
This is expressed in four current trends:

Quickly evolving environment::
Stakeholders’ demand patterns are evolving rapidly: customers, partners, and regulators have pressing needs; investors are demanding growth, which results in acquisitions and restructuring; and competitors and collaborators demand action to accommodate fast-changing priorities
footnote:[An agile organization has partners and not suppliers.
Your purchase department is not a sadistic group trying to pressure rebates out of your vendors and forgetting all about quality and supply chains.].
Constant introduction of disruptive technology::
Established businesses and industries became a commodity or were replaced through digitization, bioscience advancements, the innovative use of new models, and automation.
Examples include developments such as machine learning, the Internet of Things, and robotics
footnote:[Evaluate your own company.
A digital organization should not possess fax machines, paper archive rooms, landlines.
You should finish the phase-out of printers, scanners, and virtual private networks.].
Accelerating digitization and democratization of information::
The increased volume, transparency, and distribution of information require organizations to rapidly engage in multi-directional communication and complex collaboration with customers, partners, and colleagues
footnote:[Check if your company issues electronic invoices.
A digital document can automatically be processed by partners' applications.
A PDF document is *not* an electronic slipper.].
The new war for talent::
As creative knowledge- and learning-based tasks become more important, organizations need a distinctive value proposition to acquire and retain the best talent.
These _knowledge workers_ often have more diverse origins, thoughts, composition, and experience and may have different desires, (for example, millennials).

== Trademarks of Agile Organizations

Agile organizations are working daily to improve.
There is no substitute for doing hard work.
They try to figure out solutions to challenging problems as they go along, using Scrum as a canvas to illuminate the way.

[quote,Kierkegaard]
____
Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forward.
____

Non-agile organizations are only talking <<detecting-agile-bullshit>>.
The illusion of agility is often established in such companies.
Internal working groups are drafting transformation plans, updated processes, and guidelines.
Where is the doing?
It was one of the findings of the SwissQ agility report 2020.

[quote,Gunther Verheyen]
____
It is not a transformation if it does not change how you work.

It is not an agile transformation if it does not simplify how you work.

It is not an agile transformation of Scrum if it does not increase the actual collaboration between customers, teams, and stakeholders.
____

Look at all these companies trying to copycat Spotify ways of working.
Their dreadful hope is that the copycat will solve all their flaws.
Agile is not magic nor a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet[silver bullet]!

Fully understand that:

* Agile does not fix poor leadership, poor management, or command-and-control culture.
* Agile does not fix lack of engagement or company political games.
* Agile does not fix people's ego or lack of motivation.
* Agile does not fix poor behaviors, culture, and mindset.
* Agile does not fix over-allocation of people or lack of focus.
* Agile does not fix poor customer focus.
Agile does not fix poor process workflow or poor collaboration.
* Agile does not fix poor HR compensation processes that do not set the right people's behavior.

Agile makes it all visible and transparent.
Beware being transparent can be excruciating and induce distress.

Agile is the framework to detect flaws and to measure improvements through an empirical process.
A huge intentional effort needs to be taken by those in the process, willing to fix or improve such things.

== Agile Teams

Here is a set of capabilities strongly improving the throughput of an agile team.
Our company is proud of how cool, professional, and effective our development teams are.
The eight tips are:

. Do Just In-Time kickoffs.
. Have at least one https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#product-owner[Product Owner] that is always available.
. Create https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shaped_skills[T-shaped] developers by pairing different disciplines.
. Do team https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_review[code reviews], better promote https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming[Pair Programming].
. Keep your https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration[pipelines] in great shape.
You shall deploy your software product multiple times a day to an integration staging area.
. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt[Technical Debt] should be zero at all times.
A powerful practice is the zero bug policy <<zero-bug-policy>>.
. Drop rituals that give you no added value.
Avoid https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult[Cargo Cult].
. Have a good mix of experience and personality in your team.
Promote continuous training and adequate certification in key technologies.
Establish a strong learning culture in your organization.
Encourage your collaborators to work on open source projects and publish on blogs.

[WARNING]
====
Fight to avoid becoming a feature factory <<twelve-signs-feature-factory>> <<twelve-signs-feature-factory-three-years-later>>.
Warning signs are:

* Your sprints do not have a written and published goal.
The content of a sprint is just a bunch of product backlog items.
* Your teams just implement stories during an opportunity.
They never adjust the Sprint backlog content to increase the odds of achieving the spring goal
