Some organisations are adopting agile and Scrum simply because they see competitors doing it.
In these situations, there is rarely a desire to adopt a new mindset and culture, or motivation for true change.
A common pattern is the adoption of new nomenclature: Project Managers are renamed as Scrum Masters, Business Analysts as Product Owners etc.
Very little actually changes.
Few benefits of agility are actually realised.
If anything, the situation may actually become worse as some previous structures are lost, yet the discipline for Agile just is not there.

Fake Scrum is around us everywhere we go.
It is unavoidable.

== Five Scrum Fake Indicators

No goals::
If a Scrum team has absolutely no goals, what is the purpose of its existence?
All good teams have goals.
Scrum bakes the concept of goals right into the framework.
We have product goals, which are a commitment to the Product Backlog.
And then we have Sprint Goals, which are a commitment to the Sprint Backlog.
Those goals are designed to help us achieve focus, get stuff done, and get results.
If you do not have goals, you have got fake Scrum.
No Self-management::
A team that cannot self-manage is a team that cannot be nimble.
They are not going to be quick.
They are going to stall.
They are going to wait to ask questions.
They will always be asking for their boss's approval.
Teams like this are very slow and the whole point of being agile is to be nimble, right?
So, if it does not feel like they are being nimble, I should look a little deeper.
Self-management is a really common problem.
It can happen from a lack of trust with the boss or the business.
It can come from a lack of trust for each other as team members.
Wherever your problems are, self-management is crucial to have working in order for Scrum to work.
If you do not have self-managing going on it is probably fake Scrum.
No deliverables::
No increment at the end of the Sprint.
The entire point of Scrum is to have releasable increments for every single Sprint.
Without that, well, we are just cranking a bunch of levers.
To get to a deliverable it is sometimes kind of challenging.
You have to write requirements in such a way that something can be delivered in just a short time frame.
Now you get to choose the size of your Sprint length.
Anything less than 30 days is perfectly fine and if you cannot build something in under 30 days, I have to ask you what is going on here?
Sounds like fake Scrum.
No transparency::
Without transparency, I cannot inspect, I cannot adapt… and if I cannot inspect and adapt, well then, the entire empirical process falls apart.
If the entire empirical process is falling apart, you have fake Scrum.
Scrum is built upon this engine.
Scrum is built upon the idea that we make things transparent.
We inspect and adapt at the appropriate frequency and that is how we manage all the complexity of product development.
We certainly cannot eliminate complexity, but we can work with it.
So, if you do not have transparency, you’ve got fake Scrum.
No results::
If you have got stakeholders that do not see a difference.
They do not care if they are not talking to your team they are not talking to your product owner.
If you are not delivering results then what is the point of your work in the first place if there is no point you are probably doing fake Scrum.

=== Final Thoughts

Become a professional Scrum master cite:[professional-scrum-master], product owenr cite:[professional-product-owner], or team developer.
