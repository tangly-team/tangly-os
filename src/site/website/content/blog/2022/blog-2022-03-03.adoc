=== Beware of Technical Debt

=== Monitor, Log, Audit

=== Use Static Code Analyzers

=== What We learnt

Fallacy of maintenance costs::
Regular technical maintenance is a well-know approach to optimize the value of product.
Why does the software industry think that maintenance is a cost point and not an investment?
Ignorance of legal consequences::
Your company and yourself are legally responsible to protect customers and stakeholders against known dangers and flaws.
You are liable to losses of money and reputation for your customers.
The big economic blocks have strengthened their protection laws and have introduced heavy fines and potential prison penalties for convicts.
Lacking professional ethics::
I will never go a physician not following hygiene and prevention good practices and regulation.
Why should I acknowledge a software developer ignoring documented and accepted approaches to improve quality and reduce risks.

Be proud to create effective and secure products
