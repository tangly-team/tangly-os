On this page we describe the ZUGFeRD format for electronic invoices.
The name ZUGFeRD (pronounced »Tsoogfaird«) is a pun on the German word »Zugpferd« which means »draft horse«.
It indicates that the new invoicing standard is positioned to play a major role regarding efficient electronic invoicing.
ZUGFeRD allows the exchange of invoices between supplier and payer without any requirements for prior arrangements.
ZUGFeRD invoices can be deployed universally and are not limited to specific industry sectors or company sizes.
Private enterprises as well as public administration can efficiently organize their invoice processing with ZUGFeRD.

The standard has been created by a working group which comprises members from the public administration, three German federal ministries, industry associations in the financial, tax and software sectors, and other organizations.
The working group is called »Forum elektronische Rechnung Deutschland« _FeRD,_ which means »Forum for electronic invoices Germany«.
The organization responsible for Factur-X is FNFE-MPE (»Forum National de la Facture Electronique et des Marchés Publics Electroniques«).

The standart will be based on the European Norm EN 16931 which defines the semantic data model of an electronic invoice.
It will be mandatory for all B2B and B2G invoices in the European Union from 2028 onwards.

== Hybrid Approaches

== Standards

EN16931

Like the XRechnung, ZUGFeRD uses the EN16931 calculation rules and the according codelists for the allowed attribute values.

Apparently, all german states accept ZUGFeRD invoices and E-Rechnung-Bund mentions the ZUGFeRD 2.1.1 XRechnung reference profile as an alternative to the XRechnung.

== Libraries

=== Mustang Library

=== Swiss QR Code

== tangly ERP

The {ref-mustang} library is a wonderful tool to create and read ZUGFeRD invoices.
The drawback is that the newer versions of the libray require a PDF/A document as input.

PDF/A is a well-defined format, but you cannot currently find open source libraries to transform a PDF document to PDF/A document.
The apache {ref-pdfbox} library for example does not explicitly support these conversions.
We finally found a free library {ref-freespire} to convert PDF to PDF/A documents
footnote:[Commercial libraries cost thousands of Euros per developer and per year.
These prices prohibit their use in open source solutions with low income flows.].

== Lessons Learnt

Governmental organizations are moving incredibly slowly.
I wrote an article on how to implement digital invoices in 2020, and now in 2024 we are still not using them on a wide scale.
The European Union has mandated the use of electronic invoices in some cases starting int2025.
Digital invoices will be mandatory in 2028.
One bright decision is that the XML data is the source of true and the PDF is just a visual representation of the invoice.
