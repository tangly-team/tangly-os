Domain model completeness is when your domain model contains all the application’s domain logic.

Domain logic fragmentation is the opposite of that — it’s when the domain logic resides in layers other than the domain layer.

Domain model purity is when your domain model doesn’t reach out to out-of-process dependencies.

In most use cases, you can’t have all 3 of the following attributes:

Domain model completeness

Domain model purity

Performance

There are three common approaches, but each of them only gives you 2 out of the 3 attributes:

Pushing all external reads and writes to the edges of a business operation — Preserves domain model completeness and purity but concedes performance.

Injecting out-of-process dependencies into the domain model — Keeps performance and domain model completeness, but at the expense of domain model purity.

Splitting the decision-making process between the domain layer and controllers — Helps with both performance and domain model purity but concedes completeness.

If you can push all external reads and writes to the edges of a business operation without much damage to application performance, choose this option.

Otherwise, choose domain model purity over completeness.
