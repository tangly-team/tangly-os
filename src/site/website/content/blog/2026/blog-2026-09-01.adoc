Our company {ref-tangly} has developed and published open source components since our inception.
We regularly write issues and pull requests on GitHub to improve the quality of open source components we are using.

All companies on this planet are using open-source components in their products.
Browsers, operating systems, databases, and programming languages are all built on open source components.

It is an ethical and social responsibility to contribute back to the open source community.
Organizations that only consume open-source componets without contributing back are free riders.
Too many free riders will kill the open-source ecosystem.

Write code that uses the current Java language features and libraries.

Embrace data programming and immutable structures.

[NOTE]
====
Make your code more legible.
Adopt the notation used in Java `record`.
Stop using the prefixes _get_ and _set_.
