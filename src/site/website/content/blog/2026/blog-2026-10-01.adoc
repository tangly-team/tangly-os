== More Functional Constructs

Functions can be defined to take different numbers of parameters, meaning different _arity_.
Different arities must all be defined in the same defn.
Using _defn_ more than once will replace the previous function.

Functions may also define a variable number of parameters.
This is known as a "variadic" function.
The variable parameters must occur at the end of the parameter list.
They will be collected in a sequence for use by the function.

(defn greet
     ([] (greet "you"))
     ([name] (print "Hello" name))
     [name & rest] (apply print "Hello" name rest))

----

An anonymous function can be created with _fn_.
Because the anonymous function has no name, it cannot be referred to later.
Rather, the anonymous function is typically created at the point it is passed to another function.
Or it is possible to immediately invoke it.
_This is not a common usage_.

map filter reduce with lambda expressions

method chaining (f2 f1 x) is equivalent to (-> x f1 f2)

Accumulative Recursion

Tail Recursion

Destructuring is a way to concisely bind names to the values inside a data structure.
Destructuring allows us to write more concise and readable code.

[source,clojure]
----
(def my-line [[5 10] [10 20]])
(let [[p1 p2] my-line
      [x1 y1] p1
      [x2 y2] p2]
 (println "Line from (" x1 "," y1 ") to (" x2 ", " y2 ")"))

(def my-vector [1 2 3])
(let [[x y z] my-vector]
  (println x y z))

(def client {:name "tangly llc"  :location "Zug, Switzerland :description "Agile boutique."})
(let [name (:name client)
      location (:location client)
      description (:description client)]
  (println name location "-" description))
