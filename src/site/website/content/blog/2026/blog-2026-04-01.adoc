== In-Memory Application

All application data is loaded in-memory using the MicroStream.
The application is fast and responsive.
You do not need to implement data provider and paging.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This approach limits the amount of data you can handle.
A modern notebook has 32 GB of RAM.
A modern server easily has 256 GB of RAM.

These limits cover most management applications.
{ref-eclipsestore} supports data sharding and lazy loading.
Therefore, the above limits can be streched even further.

== Grid Sorting and Filtering

== Vaadin Component Factory

[TIP]
====
Consultants often condemn server-side solutions.
They declare these solutions not scalable and usable in a productive context.

I concur that it would not be possible to implement Twitter with this approach.
But how much memory does a Vaadin application need?

Experiments show that around 9'000 parallel users require 1 GB of RAM.
A small server has easily 4 GB and would handle more than 30'000 parallel users without any problem.

Be honest.
The solutions we are developing seldom have more than a few hundreds of concurrent users.
Very few deployed applications have more than 5'000 users.

== Tips and Tricks

Vaadin is a strong framework.
It is sometimes flakey.
Major refactoring with classes and packages relocationss seems to distress the framework.
If yu get a Vaadin frontend compilation error, try to clean the project.
Cleaning means execute `vaadin:clean` and delete all generated files in the project.

We also sometimes have the strange effect that the gralde project is building perfectly with the option `-Pvaadin.productionMode` but not without.
This seems to indicate that the gradle plugin does quite different things in both cases.
