We hope that the metaphor of the universe will steer you away from having to manage all artifacts in the form of a document.
You should just have these artifacts tangible in some form that allows all stakeholders involved to communicate about them in a reasonable way.

Think of these artifacts as a cabinet, where each artifact has its own compartment.
The cabinet today should of course not be one filled with lots of paper in different compartments, but rather a wiki with an appropriate structure or some other electronic collection.
With such a cabinet, you can number the product owner’s universe and place the artifacts in the respective cabinet compartment.

== Artifacts

The following figure shows you the “universe of the product owner” from req42.
The “guiding star” in the middle is of course the Product Backlog as the most important artifact, with which you will certainly spend most of your time.
Around it many other artifacts are revolving that you should take seriously in your role as a product owner.

The blue planets are the more requirements-oriented deliverables, the red planets are the more management-oriented records, and the green planet represents your deliverables.
