Time is omnipresent in software development.
Pretty much every application works with it in one way or another.
Even the simplest blogging platform stores _when_ a post should be published and then displays and sorts them using that information.
While you might not run into any issues when developing a blogging platform, any more complex system can easily expose how complicated time actually is.

== Local Time

- LocalDate
- LocalDateTime
- Timestamp
- YearMonth

== HasDate

== HasDateRange

=== Time Ranges

- Is date in range?
- Is date range in range?
