What is dependency injection?

{ref-di} is a programming technique aka a pattern that makes a class independent of its dependencies.
It is achieved by decoupling the use of an object from its creation.
So instead of creating an instance of the object, I implement it by injecting it from the outside.

The goal of DI is to improve code reusability.
This technique aims to reduce the frequency with which a class needs to be modified.
Dependency injection supports these goals by decoupling the creation from the use of an object.
This allows dependencies to be replaced without changing the class that uses them.
It also reduces the risk of having to change a class just because one of its dependencies has changed.

== What is the best Way to inject Dependency?

The ideal technique to introduce dependency depends on the particular circumstances.

Constructor injection is typically regarded as the most effective method of injecting dependencies.

This is so because it is straightforward, explicit, and simple to test.
The dependencies are passed to the constructor of the object during constructor injection.
The object will always be initialized with all of its dependents, and it will be clear which dependencies the object requires.

Constructor injection is the best way to inject dependencies because:

- It makes sure that an object is generated in a valid state. +
_Construction is initialization idiom reduces programming errors._
- By doing this, the probability of running into null reference exceptions later on in the application’s execution is decreased.
- It makes dependencies explicit that means a class exposes all its class-level dependencies in its constructor. +
_Increases legibility and testability of the code._
- It enables the use of immutable objects. +
_We love immutable objects._

Overall advantages of dependency injection are:

- Dependency-driven increased modularity and reusability of code.
By separating components from their dependencies, injection encourages a clear separation of concerns.
Developers can quickly alter or switch out parts of the application without compromising the overall functionality.
- Enhanced testability.
Using Dependency Injection makes it much simpler to test individual components since dependencies can be simply mocked or stubbed.
It is possible to test the behavior of individual components without also testing the behavior of all of their dependencies.
- Enhanced code maintainability is possible because Dependency Injection removes the requirement for components to handle the creation and management of dependencies, as this is done by an external system.

As a result, there is less duplication of code, improving maintainability.
Here are few examples where using DI can increase the quality of your code:

- Injecting a database connection into your service layer through DI is possible.
Your service layer will be simpler to test and manage as a result, regardless of the database implementation strategy.
- You can use DI to add a logger to your controller layer.
This will make it simpler for you to log errors and other events because you won’t have to worry about how to set up the logger.
- An application configuration object can be introduced via DI.
As a result, changing your application’s setup will be simple and have no impact on the remaining code.

== Tangly OS Approach

The open source components of {ref-tangly-blog-url} use constructor injection to inject dependencies.

The applications we build are modular and based on the domain-driven design approach.
The derived simplicity allows us to handcode the dependency injection.
We currently have no need for a dependency injection framework.

The instantiation of a specific bounded domain instance is done in a factory method.
The code is simple and easy to understand.
The number of statements is below twenty.

The same approach is applied to create a bounded domain user interface.
