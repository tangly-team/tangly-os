I am a Swiss citizen, and I am quite happy to live in Switzerland.

But there are some issues that I would like to address.
The quality of life and the standard of living in Switzerland are high.
The last years these have been slowly decreasing.

I am a software engineer and a father of two daughters.
I could now live in Spain, Germany, France, Denmark, or the Netherlands and have the same or higher income and quality of life.

As a parent, I want to provide my daughters opportunities for the best possible future.

Below are some issues I found out in the last years.
I am a father of two wonderful daughters.
I found out which aspects are not optimal for the future of my children.

== No digital identity for Swiss citizens

We currently have no access to digital identity in Switzerland.

You have to give your child a physical identification card, often also physical money, physical travel cards, and a physical health insurance card.
All parents know that children lose things.

Replacing a lost card is a nightmare.
It takes weeks, and it is naturally not a digital process.
Additionally, you have to pay quite a fee for the replacement.

[NOTE]
====
The government is currently working on a digital identity for Swiss citizens.
Hopefully, we shall get it in 2026 at the earliest.

Some transportation companies are working on a digital travel card.
Availability is almost a lottery based on the company.
====

== No digital payment card for children younger than 12 years

For mysterious reasons, Swiss banks do not allow children younger than 12 years old to have a digital payment card.
In the age of digitalization and after Corona lockdown, this is a major issue.

I have to give my children physical money for their pocket money or to buy things.
So I am forced to find an ATM and withdraw money regularly.

== No possibility to open a stock account for children

How should you finance the education of your children if you cannot invest in the stock market?

This is quite impossible in Switzerland.

For mysterious reasons, Swiss banking does not allow children to invest in the stock market.
You have to wait until your child is 18 years old to open a regular stock account.

Some banks other pseudo accounts, but they force you to buy their products and are not real stock accounts.
You are forced to buy their funds instead of investing in regular ETFs.
These funds are poorly performing and have high yearly fees.
See, for example, the funds of {ref-postfinance}.

It is a major issue for the future of the country.

== Twenty-six education systems for nine million inhabitants

States are responsible for the education system in Switzerland.
Worst, details are often left to the municipalities.

So we have 26 different education systems for 9 million inhabitants.
This is a nightmare for parents who move to another canton.
And imagine, we have in 2024 2131 municipalities in Switzerland issuing nursery, primary and sometimes secondary school reglementations.

[NOTE]
====
As usual the {ref-svp} opposed the initiative to align the education systems.
The initiative was called _Lehrplan 21_.

The Swiss citizens voted for the harmonization of the education system.
Around 21 cantons are currently working on the harmonization.
Some are more progressive than others.

The Swiss education system is quite good.
The hard fact is quite good, not especially outstanding.
====

All Swiss German states are also teaching the French language as mandatory in primary and secondary school.
My mother tongue is French, and I will happily scrap French from the curriculum.

The poor children must be fluent in Swiss German, High German, and English.
Three languages are enough for a child.
Please scrap mandatory French from the curriculum.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The {ref-futureday} is a great governmental initiative to show children the work of their parents.
Try to get a place in a technical company for your child.
It is worth the effort.

The initiative is quite successful.
The drawback is that it is once a year and not all children can get a slot to participate.
====

== Force to use Microsoft Office in schools

Most Swiss cantons heavily promote the usage of Microsoft Office in schools.

This is a major issue for parents who do not want to use Microsoft products.
It is also an ethical issue as Microsoft is a US company and the data is stored in the US.

[NOTE]
====
And please do not come with the argument that Microsoft has a data center in Switzerland.

The US laws are still valid for the data stored in Switzerland.
The US government can still access and process the data stored in Switzerland and forbid Microsoft to inform the Swiss government.
====

== Cannot listen to regular music on YouTube or Spotify

The music industry bowed to the pressure of the US government.
As a child, you cannot listen to music containing adult language on YouTube or Spotify.

The word fuck is forbidden, and any song containing it cannot be played by children.

I would like as a parent to be in charge of such decisions.
I do not recognize that some fringe Christian groups force such decisions on all children on this planet.

[NOTE]
====
The positive news is that we have access to all books in our libraries.
Censorship like in the US is unknown in most communal or cantonal libraries.

The nightmare for US librarians did not snap over to Switzerland.
The {ref-svp} tried an initiative and was crushed by common sense.
====

== No roaming in the EU when traveling and visiting family

The Swiss government has not signed the agreement with the EU to allow roaming in the EU.

They still advocate that Swiss citizens should stay in Switzerland and not have any friends or family in the EU.

== No membership to European education initiatives

I know it is the official position of the {ref-svp} political right party, but it is a shame for the country.

The strange idea to define exchange programs with China or Singapore is laudable.
Requesting students to travel to China or Singapore to study marine biology is quite a joke.

[NOTE]
====
One of my daughters currently wants to study marine biology.

It should be obvious that you cannot study marine biology, avionic, or space engineering in Switzerland.
You have to go to the EU to study these subjects.

Switzerland was stupid enough to leave the student exchange program {ref-erasmus} and the research program {ref-horizon}.
You more and more need European citizenship to study in the EU.

The country tried to set up alternative Swiss programs.
These initiatives were doomed to fail.
The first top researchers and postdocs are leaving the country.
====

The same party also opposes dual citizenship.
They promote the strange and partially illegal concept of Swiss citizenship on probation.

This means that my daughters and wife should give up their Swiss citizenship if they want to keep their European citizenship.
Worse, the same party promotes the far-right ideology and wants to send foreigners back to their country.

So, my daughters who were born and educated in Switzerland should be sent back to Germany accordingly to the SVP party.

== Thoughts

Switzerland is a beautiful country with a high quality of life.
I am happy to live here.

But the country is not ready for the future and the digital age.

The country is certainly not an ideal place for my daughters with the current xenophobic political parties.
The current political trends will almost certainly lead to a worsening for the quality of life in Switzerland.

[NOTE]
====
Lately I read official statistics about knowledge workers in Switzerland.
More than 40% of all doctors, engineers, and IT specialists are foreigners because the country does not produce enough of them
footnote:[The political system at least realized the acute problem for doctors.
The _numerus clausus_ for doctor formation was removed in 2024.
The decision will not have any impact in the next twelve years.
You need six years to study medicine and another six years of practice to get the full accreditation.
Therefore, any change is only visible after twelve years.

It will probably take longer because cantons are in charge of university formation and the classroom size.].

In other words, our education system is flawed and under performing.
The education system does not produce enough knowledge workers for the needs of the country.
The situation will degrade more rapidly in the next ten years because baby boomers are now retiring in big numbers.
====

The country has to ask itself how to stay competitive and attractive in the future.
