My current notebook has twelve cores.
The programs I develop should be able to utilize all of them.

A server can easily have 128 or more cores.
The programs should adapt automatically to the number of cores available.

We are developing user interfaces that should be responsive.
Longer operations should not block the user interface and be run in the background.

The solution to these problems is to use multithreading when designing and programming applications.
--

There are several reasons as to why one would use multithreading in an application. Some of the most common reasons for multithreading are:

* Better utilization of a single CPU.
* Better utilization of multiple CPUs or CPU cores.
* Better user experience in regard to responsiveness.
* Better user experience in regard to fairness.

== First Iteration

=== Threads

You can create a thread by extending the Thread class and overriding the run method.
You need to call the start method to start the thread.

[source,java]
----
public class ThreadExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        var thread = new NewThread();
        thread.start();
    }
}
----

=== Synchronized

We can use the synchronized keyword on different levels:

* Instance methods
* Static methods
* Code blocks

When we use a synchronized block, Java internally uses a monitor, also known as a monitor lock or intrinsic lock, to provide synchronization.
These monitors are bound to an object; therefore, all synchronized blocks of the same object can have only one thread executing them at the same time.

The lock behind the synchronized methods and blocks is a reentrant.
This means the current thread can acquire the same synchronized lock over and over again while holding it.

[source,java]
----
public synchronized void performSynchronisedTask() {
    setCount(getCount()+1);
}

public void performSynchronisedTask() {
    synchronized (this) {
        setCount(getCount()+1);
    }
}
----

=== Volatile

We can use volatile to tackle the issues with Cache Coherence.

To ensure that updates to variables propagate predictably to other threads, we should apply the volatile modifier to those variables.

This way, we can communicate with runtime and processor to not reorder any instruction involving the volatile variable.
Also, processors understand that they should immediately flush any updates to these variables.

[IMPORTANT]
====
In modern Java, the synchronized and the thread concepts are obsolete and should not be used.
Try avoiding using the volatile keyword as well.

== Second Iteration

=== Executors

The executor concept is a higher-level abstraction for managing threads.
It is a more flexible and powerful way to manage threads than the Thread class and avoids most of its pitfalls.

=== Concurrent Primitives and Collections

Java provides a set of concurrent primitives and collections to work with threads.
These classes are thread-safe and can be used in a multithreaded environment.
They are simpler and more efficient than using synchronized blocks.

=== Fork and Join

The fork and join solution implements the _divide and conquer_ algorithm.
The subtasks are created and executed in parallel.
The results are then combined to get the final result in the _join_ phase.

The ForkJoinPool is a special kind of executor that is designed to work with the ForkJoinTask.

[NOTE]
====
The correct implementation of your algorithm using the fork and join framework is not trivial.
It was a standard trick question in the Java certification examinations.

The order of divide and conquer tasks declaration in the code is crucial for a correct execution.
====

== Third Iteration

=== Parallel Streams

The stream API was introduced in Java 8.
It is a powerful way to work with collections in a functional way.
The paradigm is data programming.

Any stream processing can easily be parallelized by calling the `parallelStream` method.
The underlying implementation uses the fork and join framework and hides all the quirks from the developer.

=== Reactive API

The reactive API supports the reactive programming model.
The classes `CompletableFuture` and `CompletableStage` provide powerful ways to work with asynchronous tasks.

Most reactive solutions are now realized with the much simpler approach based on _virtual threads_.
_Think twice before using the reactive API_.

== Forth Iteration

=== Virtual Threads

Virtual threads allow the scaling of any IO-based processing.
Conceptually, it replaces and simplifies the reactive approach and makes it obsolete.

=== Structured Concurrency

Structured concurrency allows you to manage your threads in a structured way in the source code.
Exceptions are propagated to the parent thread, and the parent thread can decide how to handle them in a try block.

=== Scoped Values

Scoped values needed to be introduced to provide data to threads.

The `ThreadLocal` class is obsolete and should not be used anymore.
It does not scale well with virtual threads.

== Good Practices

Use the modern Java constructs in your codebase.
Immutability and functional programming are key approaches to legible and working parallel code.

*Prefer the message passing pattern over shared memory.*
Immutable objects and message passing are the key to parallel programming in bigger systems.
I highly recommend choosing the actor model <<actor-model>> as your architecture pattern.

*Use parallel streams for parallelizing your algorithm processing data.*
If you need to parallelize your algorithms, use `parallelStream`.
It is a straightforward way to parallelize your code without the need to manage threads.
The code is legible and painless to maintain.

*Seldom use structured concurrency to manage more complex algorithms to parallelize processing if data.*
Try to always use structured concurrency to manage your threads.
Use virtual threads to parallelize your IO operations.

All constructs of the first iteration meaning threads, synchronized, and volatile are obsolete and should be avoided.

If you have the need to provide data to threads, use scoped values.
