=== Eliminate Dead Links

The biggest advantage of a website is the capability to link information to the reference document or the official description.
As a user, I just need to click the link to access details.
It is quite important that a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink[hyperlink] works when the user clicks on it.

Sadly, website authors do not fully understand the concept of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier[universal resource locator] _URI_
Linked pages work well if links are defined as permanent uniform resource locators.

We want to improve the experience of our users.
All links of a website should regularly be validated.
Dead links should be eliminated.

[TIP]
====
A dead link in our websites is removed.
A footnote is added to document the removal and to provide a hint about the information previously referenced through the connection.

The idea is to provide a primitive history to the interested readers.
====

The available utilities to check dead links have limitations or require expensive subscriptions.
On a rainy day, we decided to write our small utility tailored to our website and needs.

The utility provides the following features:

- Parse recursively our website and extract all links.
- Ignore all links to javascript libraries: jQuery, lunr, mathJax.
- Ignore all links to ebook on Amazon website.
The Amazon site refuses connection requests as soon as the frequency hints to a program.
- List all failed connections with the source page, the link and the error message encountered.

==  Bibliography

We write often technical articles.

References are provided and follow a standardized format for all bibliographical references.
We want to increase the confort for the user.
Most of the references contain a link to the book description on the Amazon website
footnote:[I chose Amazon because I bought all my ebooks there.
I do not own anymore paper editions.
You could decide to use another universal bookstore if you prefer.].
