== Spellchecker and Grammar

I am not an English native speaker and also not really talented with foreign languages.
I should find ways to improve the structure of my articles and remove typographical errors.

The IntelliJ environment provides a build-in spellchecker the Grazie plugin to detect grammar errors.
The plugin uses https://languagetool.org/[language tool] to provide hints.
The spellchecker supports the extension of supported words.
When writing technical texts, assume that quite a few words are not part of a standard dictionary.

[CAUTION]
=====
The grammar checker cannot be easily tailored and has limitations.

For example, the expression _Scrum Master_ is often flagged as political incorrect.
You get the hint that the word _master_ should be avoided.
This hint is quite useless in the context of the {ref-scrum} approach.
=====

== Eliminate Dead Links

The biggest advantage of a website is the capability to link information to the reference document or the official description.
As a user, I just need to click the link to access details.
It is quite important that a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink[hyperlink] works when the user clicks on it.

Sadly, website authors do not fully understand the concept of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier[universal resource locator] _URI_
Linked pages work well if links are defined as permanent uniform resource locators.

We want to improve the experience of our users.
All links of a website should regularly be validated.
Dead links should be eliminated.

[TIP]
====
A dead link in our websites is removed.
A footnote is added to document the removal and to provide a hint about the information previously referenced through the connection.

The idea is to provide a primitive history to the interested readers.
====

The available utilities to check dead links have limitations or require expensive subscriptions.
On a rainy day, we decided to write our small utility tailored to our website and needs.

The utility provides the following features:

- Parse recursively our website and extract all links.
- Ignore all links to javascript libraries: jQuery, lunr, mathJax.
- Ignore all links to ebook on Amazon website.
The Amazon site refuses connection requests as soon as the frequency hints to a program.
- List all failed connections with the source page, the link and the error message encountered.

==  Bibliography

We often write technical articles.

References are provided and follow a standardized format for all bibliographical references.
We want to increase the comfort for the user.
Most of the references contain a link to the book description on the Amazon website
footnote:[I chose Amazon because I bought all my ebooks there.
I do not own anymore paper editions.
You could decide to use another universal bookstore if you prefer.].

We provide a bibtex file with all the books we bought and referenced in our articles.
Feel free to use it.
It is released as all our articles under https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/[creative commons attribution 4.0 international] _CC BY 4.0_
footnote:[The license is displayed in the footer of {ref-uri-blog}.].

== Statistics

I welcome data helping me to better understand the structure of my technical website.

I find it interesting to know:

- Year of publication
- How many articles did I write in a specific year?
- How manu times is an article referenced in other blogs?
Average number of references to a blog are published in a specific year?
- How many article references are defined in an article?
Average number of articles references are published per blog in a specific year?
- How many book references are defined in an article?
Average number of book references are published per blog in a specific year?
