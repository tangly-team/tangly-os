I am using agile approaches to develop digital products for 25 years.
I truly enjoy the agile principles and values.
The created digital products were quite successful on the market.
Some of them are still in use.
I regularly have to smile when I use an elevator in a hotel and know that some of the software we developed is used to move it.

Honestly, I do not care if you prefer {ref-scrum}, {ref-kanban}, {ref-xp}, or your own agile approach.
I am not a fan of {ref-saf}.
If you are more successful with {ref-saf}, I am happy for you.
Please feel free to use it.

I am an engineer and an entrepreneur.
A method is a tool for me.
The approach is good if your digital product is _more_ successful on the market.

And I really hate the agile methologist zealots and the agile ignorants.
I provide below some examples I still regularly encounter with new customers.

== Psycho Scrum Masters

Psycho Scrum masters are probably the worst agile zealots.
Their mantra is _It is always a people problem._
_Coach them to work as a team and all problems will be solved_.

I heartily agree that a team that works well together is more productive.
But you have to be reasonable.
I will never let a person without deep health care skills work as a doctor and perform surgery on me.

In other words, it is not always a people problem.
It can be a technical capability difficulty.
To acquire technical skills, you need formal education and years of experience.
A few team building exercises cannot solve such troubles.

You need technical training and skills for technical jobs.
You need Scrum Masters with technical skills to coach software development teams.
How can you help a team improve their digital product development processes and techniques if you have no clue about software development?

Professional Scrum Masters have a technical background if their team develops digital products

== Pretending to Apply DevOps

Proud teams regularly and proudly explain to me they are applying DevOps and release their software every two weeks.
_This is not DevOps_.
_This is a lie._

DevOps means you release multiple times a day or at least once a day <<devops-handbook,phoenix-project>>.
It also means that your continuous integration, delivery, and deployment pipelines are fully automated.
No manual steps should be required in the pipeline.

== Backlog as Requirements Document

The product backlog is not a requirements document.
It is a list of activities to improve the digital product and move it forward.

The size of the product backlog should cover activities for the two next sprints.
A product backlog with 100 items is a sign of a dysfunctional product owner.
It is not a wish list.
It describes what we should do in the next weeks.

To be clear.
A product backlog item can be the current version of a requirement or a user story.
You use a specification-by-example approach <<bridging-communication-gap>>.
Each story has acceptance criteria.
Each acceptance criteria is implemented by one or more automated acceptance tests.

These acceptance tests are the requirements formulated as specification by example.
You can add some annotations to the tests to generate legible documentation.

== Agile is not a Silver Bullet

Agile approaches are perfect tools to detect early problems and visualize them.
You are still responsible for solving them.

I will again emphasize the obvious.
You need technical skills and formal technical education to solve technical problems.

== Thoughts on Agile

I am applying for twenty-five years.
The sound principles and values are still valid.
They help me to identify issues and solve them before they become costly problems.

If you find a better approach, I am happy for you.
Use it and create the next Unicorn company.
