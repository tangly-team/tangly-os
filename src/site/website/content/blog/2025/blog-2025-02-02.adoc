What a journey it has been!

Nine years ago, we founded our company {ref-tangly}.
We are a Java and agile digital product development boutique.

We are going strong and tremendously enjoying the journey.

We always wanted to nuture a company where collaborators are happy and proud to work.

Agile approaches and principles are the foundation of our company.

The {ref-bbrt} has been a source of inspiration for our company since its inception in 2016.
They try to rethink how we manage organizations in a post-industrial world.

They advocate a progressive set of leadership principles and management processes proven to free organisations of _command and control_ cultures and improve performance.

== Beyond Budgeting Principles

The {ref-bbrt} proposed twelve principles in 2011.

I added _italics_ comments how our company interprets and applies these ideas.

_Governance and transparency_::
Values:::
Bind people to a common cause; not a central plan. +
+
_We are a technical agile boutique specialized in the Modern Java stack.
We strongly believe you can create awesome digital products the agile way, with Java.
The teams will enjoy the work every day and be proud of delivering products improving quality of life._ +
+
_Great companies are not in business to make money, they make money to stay in business and accomplish an important purpose._
Governance:::
Govern through shared values and sound judgment; not detailed rules and regulations. +
+
_We are proud to have very few regulations._
_These documents are all a one-pager._
_We expect our collaborators to apply common sense and to act in the best interest of the company and the customer._ +
+
_We align collaborators through transparency of their handling and implicit peer review._
Transparency:::
Make information open and transparent; do not restrict and control it. +
+
_All collaborators have access to all documents of the company.
Customers sometimes require confidentiality for specific initiatives.
In this case the project artifacts visibility is limited to the team working on them._
_Accountable teams_::
Teams:::
Organize around a seamless network of accountable teams; not centralized functions. +
+
_We have a flat organization with a few roles.
All product development initiatives are organized as value streams. +
The only specialized role in the company is the accounting.
If a collaborator is interested in finance, we will train him to take over this role._
Trust:::
Trust teams to regulate their performance; do not micromanage them. +
+
_We trust our collaborators to do the right thing.
All collaborators understand the company's purpose and values._

Accountability:::
Base accountability on holistic criteria and peer reviews; not on hierarchical relationships. +
+
_Our culture strongly emphasizes meritocracy.
We are qualified specialists in technical agility and digital software product development._ +
+
_We have a profit center accounting structure.
Each collaborator has access to all financial data and can see how she is doing._
_Goals and Rewards_::
Goals:::
Set ambitious medium-term goals, not short-term fixed targets. +
+
_We want to be recognized as one of the best technical agile boutiques in Switzerland._ +
_We do not have any fixed targets for our collaborators._
Rewards:::
Base rewards on relative performance; not on meeting fixed targets. +
+
_This is fully implemented._
_Planning and Controls_::
Planning:::
Make planning a continuous and inclusive process; not a top-down annual event. +
+
_Planning is rolling.
We develop some tools to fully support rolling visualization of acquisition and financial reporting._
Coordination:::
Coordinate interactions dynamically; not through annual budgets. +
+
_We have no annual budgets or quaterly goals.
We emphasize rolling decision-making._
Resources:::
Make resources available just-in-time; not just-in-case. +
+
_We are practising Kanban.
We have a pull culture and a just-in-time realization approach._
Controls:::
Base controls on fast, frequent feedback; not budget variances. +
+
_All collaborators look at the realtime progress of the digital product development they are working on.
Fast feedback loops allow us to adapt our plans and actions.
This feedback hugely improves collaborator, customer, and stakeholder satisfaction._ +
+
_We have no budget, therefore, we have no budget variances._

== Adaptive Product Development

Agile approaches promote adaptive product development and the ability to respond to change.
Methods such as Design Thinking, Lean Startup, {ref-xp}, and {ref-scrum} are the foundation to develop digital products.

Working as a lecturer and coach for technical universities is very rewarding.
We can share our experience and knowledge with the next generation of software engineers.

Switzerland has too few software engineers, and the situation is getting worse.

Our country has no clear MINT strategy.

We hope our contribution helps a little to improve the situation.

We have the privilege to work with students and professors on the latest research and development projects.

My current courses and projects were:

- Software Architecture and Techniques
- Programming Concepts and Paradigms
- Digital product development and design thinking approaches
- Coach for semester and bachelor's degree projects and theses.
