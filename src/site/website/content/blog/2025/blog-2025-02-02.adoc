=== Beyond Budgeting Principles

The {ref-bbrt} proposed twelve principles in 2011.
I added _italics_ comments how our company interprets and applies these ideas.

Governance and transparency::
Values:::
Bind people to a common cause; not a central plan. +
+
_italics_
Governance:::
Govern through shared values and sound judgment; not detailed rules and regulations. +
+
_italics_
Transparency:::
Make information open and transparent; don't restrict and control it. +
+
_italics_
Accountable teams::
Teams:::
Organize around a seamless network of accountable teams; not centralized functions. +
+
_italics_
Trust:::
Trust teams to regulate their performance; do not micromanage them. +
+
_italics_
Accountability:::
Base accountability on holistic criteria and peer reviews; not on hierarchical relationships. +
+
_italics_
Goals and rewards::
Goals:::
Set ambitious medium-term goals, not short-term fixed targets. +
+
_italics_
Rewards:::
Base rewards on relative performance; not on meeting fixed targets. +
+
_italics_
Planning and controls::
Planning:::
Make planning a continuous and inclusive process; not a top-down annual event. +
+
_italics_
Coordination:::
Coordinate interactions dynamically; not through annual budgets. +
+
_italics_
Resources:::
Make resources available just-in-time; not just-in-case. +
+
_italics_
Controls:::
Base controls on fast, frequent feedback; not budget variances. +
+
_italics_
