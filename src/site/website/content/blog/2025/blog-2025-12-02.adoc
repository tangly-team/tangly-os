You should learn to write a technical blog.

It is a great way to share your knowledge and expertise.
It sharpens your skills and helps you to learn new things.

I acknowledge that not everyone has the privilege of creating content alongside completing their daily job duties and personal responsibilities, but it is a worthy investment.

It is a great way to display your knowledge and expertise.

I expect a technical company to host a blog on their website.
How can I otherwise find out the capabilities of the company?

Collaborators shall regularly write blog posts about their work, technical competences, and experiences.
--

The writing will train your coaching capabilities.
Each blog post is a small coaching session for your eager readers.

Write the blog post first for yourself.
You will learn a lot by writing the blog post.
Your goal is not marketing, but learning.

== Technical Aspects

I write my blog posts in the {ref-asciidoc} format.
This format is easy to write and has great expressiveness.
I often use bibliographic references and links to other blog posts.
These features are well-supported in Asciidoc.

Each blog post has front matter meta-information with tags classifying the post.
A featured image is also included in the front matter.
The image is displayed at the top of the blog post and in the list of blog posts.

[NOTE]
====
The structure I use for my blog posts is somewhat different from the standard structure expected in {ref-hugo}.
Hugo expects each blog post in a separate folder with the images in the same folder.
The name of the blog post is the name of the folder.
The name of the blog file must be `index.adoc`.

The blogs are grouped by year in folders.
Each blog post is a separate file in the folder and named `blog-YEAR-MONTH-NUMBER.adoc`.
The title of the blog post is in the front matter of the file.

Therefore, I cannot use the page bundle feature of Hugo.
The consequence is that I have to include the image file name in the front matter of the blog post and copy the featured image in the regular {ref-hugo}
`assets` folder.
The {ref-docsy} theme needs two small changes in the partial `featured-image.html` to display the featured image.
First, the name of the image is retrieved from the front matter parameter `featured`.
Second, the partial was extended to handle SVG images.

== You Should Enjoy the Experience

Always stick to simple language, irrespective of how complex the subject is, and convey it straightforwardly.
Keep in mind that the approach of technical blog writing is anything that can be broken into easy concepts.

The idea is to make interested in the subject and not get intimidated by it.

Make sure to add at least one image in your blog which gives an overview.
To further explain the concepts, you can add images to the body of the blog.
It is always more appealing to add images.

It is worth investing some time to polish up your website.
I use the {ref-integrity} tool to check all the links on my website.
The tool is free and easy to use.
It guarantees that the website has no dead links, ensuring a good user experience.

I added support for a dark theme to my website.
People can now choose between a light and a dark theme by clicking on the sun or moon icon in the top right corner of the website.

The article list now displays with a featured picture.
THe visual effect is more appealing.

I tune the company logo SVG file to have a nicer title bar.
The upgraded bar is now more responsive on mobile devices.

[TIP]
====
The fine-tuning of the website is a continuous process and sometimes time intensive.

The improved user experience is worth the effort.
====

== Lessons Learnt

Set you a goal to write a blog post quarterly or monthly.
Gather ideas for blog posts in a list.

Write the blog post to explain what you learned when working on your current product development.
Your goal is not to discover new things, but to explain what you learned.
Your readers can use your insights to improve their efficiency.

Writing in English massively increases the number of potential readers.
Use a grammar checker to improve your English.
