=== Agile Digital and Software Product Development

Scrum is the de-facto standard approach to create digital products.
Small and medium companies develop new services and products with the help of small size teams.
They do not have the resources to build a huge development organization with hundreds of developers.
{ref-scrum} and in bigger setup {ref-less} approaches are ideal matches for these initiatives.

Agile and Scrum frameworks are used to create new products and services.
They are *not* project methods.
Customers buy products not projects.

Scrum supports us in the setup, team dynamics and priorization of features and releases.
No answers are provided how to develop the solution.
Your organization needs to reach technical fluency.
The teams have to growth their organizational and technical capabilities simultaneously <<[reflections-on-agile-fluency-model>>.

=== Functional Requirements

traceability through TDD and ATDD

Continuous integration and delivery

Translation and user manual

=== Architecture Characteristics

=== Lessons Learnt

Here questions we discussed with development teams.

[qanda]
Does domain-driven design have similarities with model-based engineering?::
Yes, Scott EVans was influenced by the model-driven design _MDD_ movement.
A model is an essential part of software design.
We need it in order to be able to deal with complexity.
the main point is that we need to communicate the model.
Does domain-driven design have similarities with SysML?::
Do we need to describe our system with UML use cases?::
How do we describe the behaviour of your system?::
But the class behavior and the constraints are not so easily expressed.
UML activity diagrams (for instance) vs. class diagrams?
How de we identify our bounded domains?::
If the design, or some central part of it, does not map to the domain model, that model is of little value, and the correctness of the software is suspect. – do we really live that?
Should we create a layered architecture?::
layers applicable to “Motion Control” and/or lower level control s.a. battery management as well?
How does it match the ROS2 approach?
Do we have entities, aggregates, and value objects?::
What is our ubiquitous language?::
A core principle of domain-driven design is to use a language based on the model.
Does our commercial framework have an impact on the architecture?::
Do we structure our Software as well in Modules?
I would opt for it.
How to cluster modules?
It is actually this sort of architectural thinking that I initially thought of when I mentioned “architecture review”
