== Choose a Primary Cloud Provider

The selection criteria are:

* The latest release of the Java version is supported.
* A file system integration approach is documented.
* Docker images can be deployed on the cloud.
* Java application can be deployed on the cloud.
* DevOps concepts are supported.
The deployment is performed with command line tools.
No user interface interaction or manual login activities are required.

https://www.heroku.com/[Heroku] is one of the seldom providers supporting the current released version of Java.

== Set up Your Environment

I recommend a step-by-step approach

Set up your development environment::
I developed all Java solutions with top-notch tools.
My IDE is the IntelliJ IDEA and supports modern Java, Groovy and Clojure.
Plugins support agile software engineering practices such documentation as code, architecture design records, and diagrams as text.
{ref-git} integration is optimal.
Development platforms such as GitHub, BitBucket, or GitLab are well-supported.
Set up your continuous integration and delivery pipeline::
Development platforms provide good pipeline solutions.
I would order the simplicity of the solutions as BitBucket being the best, GitHub being usable, and GitLab solutions being too complex to reach a goal.
This judgement is reflected in the complexity of the scripts.
Take a look at the scripts of the tangly open source components
Set up your continuous deployment pipeline::
Test locally the building and publishing process of your application.
I currently provide a dual approach.
First, a docker image is provided for simple deployment to Cloud provider or interested parties.
They can run the solution in their local Docker environment.
Second, a regular Java application is provided for SaaS environments.
The solution can be run in any environment supporting the current released Java JDK.
The complexity is located in the persistence requirements of the application.
How persistence solutions are provided is quite heterogeneous in the current cloud offerings.
Set up your monitoring solution::
Monitor your application.
Find out the response times your users encounter.

== Thoughts

I already have a continuous integration and continuous delivery pipeline setup for the application.
I am not really interested in setting up it again on a proprietary cloud provider solution.
GitHub, GitLab, and BitBucket are well-known platforms for agile software development and application packaging.

The cloud solution shall concentrate on the functions of deploying an application and monitoring it.
