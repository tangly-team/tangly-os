It is official.
The power engine of SAFe 4.6 vehicle is the team and technical agility.
View the https://v46.scaledagileframework.com/whats-new-in-safe-46/[official presentation] and more important download the
https://v46.scaledagileframework.com/whats-new-in-safe-46[slides].
It is one of their five Lean Enterprise competencies and one of their four core values.
SAFe finally recognizes the tremendous importance of https://v46.scaledagileframework.com/team-and-technical-agility/[technical proficiency and craftsmanship].

They advocate two findings.
First, you need team agility, how you apply Scrum or Kanban.
In other words, _being agile instead of doing agile_.
Second, you need technical agility, how you develop a quality product.

I challenge you.
If you are following {ref-safe}, talk with your teams and checks how many of their official good practices are you using on a daily basis.

I have seen {ref-safe} introductions in Swiss, German and Czech companies.
Attention was set on the structure of the release train and a lot of effort was spent on the various ceremonies, meetings and artifacts.
But how to produce quality software and apply technical excellence was sadly always an afterthought.
And more than once a senior {ref-safe} coach just publicly stated that the {ref-safe} core value x is not so important for a successful introduction.
Quite a denial approach of his own methodology, I think!

Be honest with yourself and your teams, either you implement the techniques described in https://v46.scaledagileframework
.com/team-and-technical-agility/[Technical Agility] and https://v46.scaledagileframework.com/built-In-quality/[Build-In Quality] chapters of {ref-safe} or you are
not agile and have no {ref-safe} power engine.
It is called https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming[cargo cult].

A good starting point are the five dimensions of build-in quality described in {ref-safe} 4.6.
And yes now {ref-safe} acknowledged the tremendous importance of a
https://v46.scaledagileframework.com/continuous-delivery-pipeline/[continuous delivery pipeline].
Experts agree you can apply DevOps only if you have continuous integration, delivery and deployment.

Once you realize where your organization stands remember that build-in quality is one of tour core values of {ref-safe}.
That I mean is walk the talk.

And please read some Internet blogs and books about {ref-less}, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_craftsmanship[Software Craftsmanship],
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming[Extreme Programming], TDD, ATTD, clean code.
Most of these concepts were defined and published in the last millennium.
It is time your teams finally adopt them and produce high quality, maintainable and cost-effective products.
This is the whole concept of the lean movement.
And I welcome the fact that {ref-safe} now explicitly mention https://v46.scaledagileframework.com/built-in-quality/[Cost of Delay].

One of the strengths of {ref-safe} is their clear statement that an agile organization transformation is only successful with lean-agile leadership.
All C-level managers are trained in lean and agile, they advocate these approaches and are visible champions.
Therefore, all managers shall be advocate technical excellence on a daily basis.

If not the seminal work of John Kotter clearly states the transformation will fail.
You will have a bunch of Scrum teams in your development department, but have none of the expected synergies at the product or company level.

Personally I prefer the {ref-less} approach, but I respect your choice - https://www.scaledagileframework.com/[SAFe],
https://www.scrum.org/resources/nexus-guide[Nexus], or https://www.scrumatscale.com/scrum-at-scale-guide/[Scrum@Scale] - as long as technical excellence is
a key aspect of your agile strategy.
Embrace technical agility and do not let your train of teams produce mediocre software every two weeks.

Employ professional software craftsmen and deliver quality products.
Follow your {ref-safe} approach, respect one of the https://v46.scaledagileframework.com/safe-core-values/[four core values] and one of the
https://v46\.scaledagileframework.com/[five core competencies] of your method.

The other big improvement is that the PI horizon is now _limited_ to 8 or 12 weeks.
No more semester or hopefully quarter cadence.

It still does not make sense to plan for three months and at the same time advocate DevOps and design thinking.

DevOps has a time horizon of days.
It is waste to have huge quarterly PI gatherings and plans just to discard them after the next DevOps finding.
You should probably just update your PI roadmap.

=== Call for Action

My call for action is fewer meetings and paper artifacts and more technical excellence.
You want to sell excellent and well-designed products, not mediocre software.
