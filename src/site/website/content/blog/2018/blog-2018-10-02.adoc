An agile team is the sole responsible for the internal quality of the product they build and maintain.

The developers shall be accountable for producing the expected quality and optimizing long-term goals of the organization.

You as a developer have an ethical, professional, and legal responsibility to ensure adequate quality for your products.

Laws protect the confidentiality of their personal and financial data.

It is a potential crime to leak credit card information, geolocation data, or the worst personal documents.

Scrum as a clear concept to answer to the seminal question:

[.text-center]
_Did we build it right?_

https://less.works/less/framework/definition-of-done.html[Definition of Done] _DoD_ is a major building block to answering this question with a sounding *yes*.

== Definition of Done

{ref-scrum} and {ref-less} have a stringent discussion concerning _Definition of Done_.
The key question is

[.text-center]
_Considering our current context and capability, what activities can be completed in each sprint?_

[.text-center]
_This subset is the initial Definition of Done._

A _Definition of Done_ is weak when it is a small subset and strong when it almost equals _Potentially Shippable_.

In huge organizations, the development teams discuss their context and select the subset of the activities that all teams think they realistically can do during the sprint.
This is their initial Definition of Done.
The teams that can do more will expand this product _Definition of Done_ within their members.

The difference between the Definition of Done and Potentially Shippable is referred to as Undone Work.

[.text-center]
_Potentially Shippable - Definition of Done = Undone Work_

The Sprint is planned according to the _Definition of Done_ and thus the _Undone Work_ is excluded.
It is planned to be left undone.

The terms _Potentially Shippable_ and _Definition of Done_ are often not used consistently.
To clarify the terms:

[horizontal]
Potentially Shippable::
All activities that must be performed before the product can be shipped.
Definition of Done::
An agreement between the teams and their Product Owner on which activities are performed inside the Sprint.
A _Definition of Done_ is perfect when it equals Potentially Shippable.
Teams strive to improve towards an ideal Definition of Done.
Undone Work::
The difference between the Definition of Done and Potentially Shippable.
When the _Definition of Done_ is perfect, then there is no _Undone Work_.
If this is not the case, the organization has to decide.
First, how we deal with the _Undone Work_.
Second, how we improve so that there is less _Undone Work_ in the future.
Unfinished, or not done—work::
that was planned in a sprint but was not completed.
This is often confused with Undone Work.
Unfinished::
is work that the team planned for but did not finish, whereas Undone Work was never even planned for?
When a team has work that was not finished, then they ought to feel anxious and discuss improvement actions during their retrospective.

Teams should never leave work-in-progress at the end of the sprint and _carry over_ to the next one.
This causes a lack of transparency and reduces flexibility.
The product owner has more trouble to change the scope of the application.
If they forecast too much work, they need to remove completed items, which they have not started yet.

== Scrum Guide Definition

The Scrum guide characterizes the _Definition of Done_ as follows:

* The _Definition of Done_ is a *formal description* of the state for the _Increment_ when it meets the *quality measures required for the product*.
* The moment a _Product Backlog Item_ meets the _Definition of Done_, an _Increment_ is born.
* The _Definition of Done_ creates *transparency* by providing everyone a shared understanding of what work was completed as part of the _Increment_.
If a _Product Backlog Item_ does not meet the _Definition of Done_, *it cannot be released or even presented* at the _Sprint Review_.
Instead, it returns to the _Product Backlog_ for future consideration.
* If the _Definition of Done_ for an increment is part of the standards of the organization, all _Scrum Teams_ must follow it as *a minimum*.
If it is not an organizational standard, the _Scrum Team_ *must* create a _Definition of Done_ appropriate for the product.
* The _Developers_ are *required to conform* to the _Definition of Done_.
If there are multiple _Scrum Teams working_ together on a product, they must mutually define and comply with the same _Definition of Done_.

== Items of a Definition of Done

* A delivery standard as defined by the team.
* It contains all requirements to get a user story into production.
* The fitness for use is evident (enough value was built to justify releasing?).
* The external quality is verified (we have built the right thing?).
* The internal quality is verified, you wrote unit tests – and all tests are green.
* The code is checked in. The branch was merged and deleted.
* Coding standards are enforced through static check tools and integrated in the continuous delivery pipeline.
* The code review was completed.
* All improvements from the code review were implemented.
* All existing unit tests remain green.
* The acceptance tests were verified by the development team.
* All integration tests were passed.
* And the Status of _done_ was confirmed by the product owner.

The following criteria are often overlooked and also need to be checked:

* Was the technical documentation updated?
* Was the user documentation updated?
* Was the user documentation localized?
* The localization for the application is done.
* The localization testing is done.
* The marketing input is done.
* The legal documents are done.
* The deployment and migration scripts are available.

The extension of the definition of done _DoD_ to deliver a potentially shippable product has often significant and profound impact on the structure of the organization and its processes.
Experienced agile coaches use the definition of done as an instrument for organizational changes.

When the undone work is slowly removed from the delivery process, it triggers structural and process changes.
For example, the separate quality department responsible for the final tests is dissolved and their expertise is integrated in the development teams.
