An agile team is sole responsible for the internal quality of the product they build and maintain.

The developers shall be accountable to produce the expected quality and optimize long terms goals of the organization.

You as a developer have an ethical, professional and legal responsibility to insure adequate quality for your products.

Laws protect the confidentiality of their personal and financial data.
It is a potential crime to leak credit card information, geolocation data or worst personal documents.

Scrum as a clear concept to answer to the seminal question:

[.text-center]
_Did we build it right?_

https://less.works/less/framework/definition-of-done.html[Definition of Done] _DoD_ is a major building block to answer this question with a sounding *yes*.

=== Definition of Done

https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html[Scrum] and {ref-less} have a stringent discussion concerning _Definition of Done_.
The key question is

[.text-center]
_Considering our current context and capability, what activities can be completed each Sprint?_

[.text-center]
_This subset is the initial Definition of Done._

A _Definition of Done_ is weak when it is a small subset and strong when it is almost equals to _Potentially Shippable_.

In huger organizations the development teams discuss their context and select the subset of the activities that all teams think they realistically can do during the Sprint.
This is their initial Definition of Done.
The teams that can do more will expand this product _Definition of Done_ within their members.

The difference between the Definition of Done and Potentially Shippable is referred to as Undone Work.

[.text-center]
_Potentially Shippable - Definition of Done = Undone Work_

The Sprint is planned according to the _Definition of Done_ and thus the _Undone Work_ is excluded.
It is planned to be left undone.

The terms _Potentially Shippable_ and _Definition of Done_ are often not used consistently.
To clarify the terms:

_Potentially Shippable_::
All activities that must be performed before the product can be shipped._ _Definition of Done_::
An agreement between the teams and their Product Owner on which activities are performed inside the Sprint.
A _Definition of Done_ is perfect when it equals to Potentially Shippable.
Teams strive to improve towards a ideal Definition of Done.
_Undone Work_::
The difference between the Definition of Done and Potentially Shippable.
When the Definition of Done is perfect then there is no Undone Work.
If this isn’t the case then the organization has to decide, first how do we deal with the Undone Work, and second how do we improve so that there is less
_Undone Work_ in the future.
_Unfinished, not finished, or not done—work_::
that was planned in a Sprint but was not completed.
This is often confused with Undone Work.
_Unfinished_::
is work that the team planned for but did not finish whereas Undone Work was never even planned for.
When a team has work that was not finished then they ought to feel anxious and discuss improvement actions during their retrospective.

Teams should never leave work-in-progress at the end of the Sprint and “carry over” to the next one.
This causes a lack of transparency and reduces scope flexibility.
If they forecast too much work, they need to remove complete items which they haven’t started yet.

=== Items of a Definition of Done

* A delivery standard as defined by the team,
* It contains all requirements to get a user story into production,
* The fitness for use is evident (enough value was built to justify releasing?),
* The external quality is verified (we have built the right thing?),
* The internal quality is verified, you wrote unit tests – and all tests are green,
* The code is checked in, if necessary the branch was closed and deleted,
* Coding standards are enforced through static check tools and integrated in the continuous delivery pipeline,
* The code review was completed,
* All improvements from the code review were implemented,
* All existing unit tests remain green,
* The acceptance tests were verified by the development team,
* All integration tests were passed,
* and the Status of “done” was confirmed by the product owner.

The following criteria are often overlooked and also need to be checked:

* Was the technical documentation updated?
* Was the user documentation updated?
* Was the user documentation localized?
* The localization for the application is done.
* The localization testing is done.
* The marketing input is done.
* The legal documents are done.
* The deployment and migration scripts are available.

The extension of definition of done to deliver a potentially shippable product has often significant and profound impact on the structure of the organization and its processes.
Experienced agile coaches use the definition of done as an instrument for organizational changes.

When the undone work is slowly removed from the delivery process it triggers structural and process changes.
For example the separate quality department responsible for the final tests is dissolved and their expertise is integrated in the development teams.
