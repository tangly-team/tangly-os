=== Empirism

The GCC compiler project migrated to C++ as implementation language:

- C++ is a standardized, well known, popular language.
- C++ is nearly a superset of C90 used in GCC.
- The C subset of C++ is just as efficient as C.
- C++ supports cleaner code in several significant cases.
- C++ makes it easier to write and enforce cleaner interfaces.
- C++ never requires uglier code.
- C++ is not a panacea but it is an improvement.

The LLVM and CLang compiler project is written in C++

The two most famous compiler suites are written in C++.
The experience seems to be very positive.

The robot operating system ROS promotes C++ and Python.
Strangely, the core libraries are still written in C.

The most famous virtual machine _Java Virtual Machine JVM_ is written is C++.

The only exception I am aware of is the Linux kernel.
Development is either done in C or in Rust.
It seems that the father of Linux Linus Torvald has a strange aversion to C++.
He stated that reviewing merge requests are way easier with C code instead of C++.
But he never provided data if the whole development activities are more efficient in C or in C++.
So I assume it is a kind of viceral opinion without scientific and statistical facts.
