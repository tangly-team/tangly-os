== Empiricism

The GCC compiler project migrated to {cpp} as implementation language:

- {cpp} is a standardized, well known, popular language.
- {cpp} is nearly a superset of C90 used in GCC.
- The C subset of {cpp} is just as efficient as C.
- {cpp} supports cleaner code in several significant cases.
- {cpp} makes it easier to write and enforce cleaner interfaces.
- {cpp} never requires uglier code.
- {cpp} is not a panacea but it is an improvement.

The LLVM and CLang compiler project is written in {cpp}

The two most famous compiler suites are written in {cpp}.
The experience seems to be very positive.

The robot operating system ROS promotes {cpp} and Python.
Strangely, the core libraries are still written in C.

The most famous virtual machine _Java Virtual Machine JVM_ is written is {cpp}.

The only exception I am aware of is the Linux kernel.
Development is either done in C or in Rust.
It seems that the father of Linux Linus Torvald has a strange aversion to {cpp}.
He stated that reviewing merge requests are way easier with C code instead of {cpp}.
But he never provided data if the whole development activities are more efficient in C or in {cpp}.
So I assume it is a kind of viceral opinion without scientific and statistical facts.
