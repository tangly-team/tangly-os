An agile architect should handle a regular set of questions for each application he is working on.

Each digital product encounters similar requirements and shall provide good solutions for the most acute restrictions.

The goal is to define an evolvable minimal architecture.
New functional and non-functional requirements shall be realized with minimal changes in the design.

Do not try to solve all the problems I can think about.
Solve stated requested features with the simplest approach you can think about.
Remember, simple solutions can be very elegant and extensible.

- How do we implement accessibility laws and requirements?
- How should we translate user interface data?
- i18n, l16n, a10y regulations and good practices

=== Scalability Themes

- How do the system components communicate with each other?
- How can we scale the solution?
- Should we prepare for sharding, geolocation, vertical scaling?

=== Security Themes

- How do we insure the requested response times?
- How is security implemented?
- How do we authenticate and authorize?

=== Persistent Data Themes

- How should we persist data?
