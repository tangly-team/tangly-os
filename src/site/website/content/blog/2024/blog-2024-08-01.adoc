Agile architecture means how enterprise architects, system architects and software architects apply architectural practice in agile software development.
An agile architect should handle a regular set of questions for each application he is working on.

Each digital product encounters similar requirements and shall provide good solutions for the most acute restrictions.

The goal is to define an evolvable minimal architecture.
New functional and non-functional requirements shall be realized with minimal changes in the design.

Do not try to solve all the problems you can think about.
Solve stated requested features with the simplest approach you can think about.
Remember, simple solutions can be very elegant and extensible.

[TIP]
====
The system you are building as probably hundreds of siblings in the world.
Study the available solutions to understand the tradeoffs of these systems.

Open source permeates the software industry.
You shall be able to read public source code and build the solution locally.

Identify weaknesses and improvement area.
Now you have the first draft of your architecture.

=== Internationalization, localization and accessibility Themes

What user interface should we define?::
Acknowledge that a software developer is missing the formal education to create good user interfaces.
You need a user interface and usability trained professional to create and refine stunning user interfaces.
Select technological solutions compatible with your technology stack
footnote:[Beware that browser based JavaScript solutions require major rework of the solution every eighteen months.
The pace of change in frameworks such as Angular, React, Vue, jQuery is stunning.
Supported standards in browsers are evolving.].
How do we implement accessibility laws and requirements?::
Your usability expert should have the tools to implement the legal requirements.
I strongly recommend that each architect attend minimual training in internationalization, localization and accessibility matters.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization[internationalization] _i18n_, localization _l16n_, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility[accessibility] _a11y_ regulations and good practices.
How should we translate user interface data?::
Your organization shall implement a translation process for all involved artifacts.
Translation activities are often outsorced to specialized companies.
You should integrate their processes in your toolchain.

=== Scalability Themes

How do the system components communicate with each other?::
Model with asynchronous communication and idempotent commands.
The {ref-actor-model} is key to simplicity and performance.
Use topics when you have multiple receivers or senders. +
+
Avoid multi-threading synchronization headaches with locks, mutexes, or semaphores as long as possible.
How can we scale the solution?::
Select a framework providing horizontal scaling.
The preferred abstraction model is the {ref-actor-model}.
A web server library such as https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/[Jetty] supports unlimited parallel user sessions without writing one line of code.
A robotic framework such as https://www.ros.org/[ROS-2] delivers concurrency on node level for free.
Should we prepare for sharding, geolocation, vertical scaling?::
Try to design business logic and data persistence along with natural slicing rules.
It should be easy to deploy an instance of your solution per country.
For Europe, you would get a scaling factor of thirty for free.
How do we ensure the requested response times?::
Fitness functions and monitoring are the current good practices.

[INFO]
====
Consider architecting your digital solution using domain driven design approach cite:[domain-driven-design,implementing-domain-driven-design,domain-driven-design-distilled].
The method heavily emphazises the partitioning along bounded domains to create independent components.

The communication between domains shall be asynchronous and event based cite:[reactive-messaging-patterns-with-actor-model,exploring-cqrs].

The solution naturally scales horizontally.
If necessary, the final application can be deployed as a set of distributed services
footnote:[The approach is promoted in multiple technical stacks such as Java Spring framework https://docs.spring.io/spring-modulith/docs/0.4.0/reference/html/[Modulith].

=== Security Themes

How should we log activities and why?::
_Review your internal documented solution_
How should we audit activities and why?::
_Review your internal documented solution_
How is security implemented?::
_Review your internal documented solution_
How do we authenticate and authorize?::
JWT and OAuth are regular approach for webservers.

=== Persistent Data Themes

How should we persist data?::
_Review your internal documented solution_
How do we journal operations performed in the program?::
_Review your internal documented solution_
How is reporting provided?::
_Review your internal documented solution_
How do we import data into the system?::
_Review your internal documented solution_

=== Release and Migration Themes

How do we release a version of the product?::
_Review your internal documented solution_
Do we support backward compatibility?::
_Review your internal documented solution_
How do we implement backward compatibility?::
_Review your internal documented solution_
How do we migrate data to a new release?::
_Review your internal documented solution_
How do we archive data?::
_Review your internal documented solution_

=== Tips

You are a talented software architect.
You are in charge to define the blueprint of your digital solution.
The {ref-less} movement has described how agile architecture could be performed <<agile-design-modeling>> <<agile-architecture-principles>>.

You shall create a similar checklist to the above one.
Document your preferred approaches for each question.
Do not forget to reference literature, good practices <<developer-assumptions>> and design patterns.

You will be able to solve almost all the design challenges you will be confronted with.
A good approach is to start with a modular monolith <<modular-monoliths>>.
