The static website build tool {ref-hugo} is awesome.

The extensive built-in feature set of {ref-hugo} and the feature-rich text-formatting options that {ref-asciidoc} offers provide a blogging experience composed of easy content management and fun writing experience.

{ref-hugo} suppports natively {ref-asciidoc} syntax.
{ref-asciidoc} files are automatically compiled with {ref-asciidoctor}, so we do not need to do anything.
Have it installed and you are ready to go.

The {ref-hugo} theme {ref-docsy} is ideal to create a good-looking software documentation site.
This theme is currently the best match I found to combine product documentation with blogging.

I can generate the whole static website and publish it in less than two minutes.
Major activities are easy to perform.

In this article I want to share some improvements I made to my website using features of {ref-asciidoc} and {ref-hugo}.

== Include Common Blocks

Quite a few articles are part of a series.
All related articles share common references.
To avoid duplication, I use the _include_ directive to include a common block of references.

The huge advantage is I only need to update the common block when a new article is published in the series.
All articles are updated without manual intervention.

This approach is easy to maintain and avoid errors.
It shows the power of {ref-asciidoc} and {ref-hugo}.
These techniques are not possible with regular blogging platforms.

== Bibliography

I use the _asciidoctor-bibtex_ plugin to include references in my articles.

The reference file is a regular bibtex file.
I use _JabRef_ to manage my references.
To simplify the life of my readers, I include a link to the amazon page of the book so that they can easily have a quick look at the book.

I am very satisfied with the result.
I acknowledge that the importance of professional references is triggered by the fact that I am a technical university lecturer.

== Taxonomies

I use taxonomies to categorize my articles.
Taxonomy support in {ref-hugo} is very powerful.
I had to adapt slightly the {ref-docsy} theme to nicely display the taxonomies in the sidebar.

== Diagrams as Code

I use {ref-plantuml} to generate UML diagrams and mindmaps.

The {ref-mermaid} plugin provides additional diagram types:

== RevealJS

== Lessons Learnt

Beware of your toolchain.
After updating some ruby modules, I could not generate bibtex citation references anymore
footnote:[The problem was an incompatibility between ruby 2.x and 3.x of one gem called _bibtex-ruby_ used by the asciidoctor bibtex extension.
Therefore, all unit tests of the package still run under the older version of ruby.
People who updated to the newer ruby discovered the problem.
The {ref-asciidoc} community solved the issue in a few weeks.].
I posted the issue on the asciidoctor GitHub, and some weeks later a new version was released.
The gem asciidoctor-bibtex-0.9.0 fixed the issue.

The following statements are helpful for ruby applications.
Beware that {ref-asciidoctor} is a ruby application.

gem outdated                                                <2>
gem update                                                  <3>
gem cleanup                                                 <4>

ruby -v                                                     <5>

<1> list all installed gems
<2> list all outdated gems
<3> update all installed gems
<4> remove old versions of gems
<5> show the current ruby version

The consequence is that I should set up a CI pipeline to check if the toolchain is still working.
