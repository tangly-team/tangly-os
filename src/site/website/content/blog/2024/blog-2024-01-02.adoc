{ref-eclipsestore}
footnote:[{ref-eclipsestore} was previously called {ref-microstream}.
The Java frameworks {ref-helidon} and {ref-micronaut} support natively EclipseStore for their persistence layer.]
is a Java-native persistence layer built for cloud-native microservices and serverless systems.
EclipseStore is the only data storage solution that uses the native Java object model instead of database-specific structure or format.

It enables storing any Java object graph of any size and complexity transaction-safe into any binary data storage such as plain files, persistent volumes, or cloud object storage.

Snapshots of the object graph differences are regularly saved to the storage.
ACID transaction journal guarantees full consistency.

Each diff is stored as a bytecode representation appended to the storage using Eclipse Serializers optimized byte format.
Objects are retrieved from the storage and restored in memory fully automated by just accessing the objects in your object graph via getter.

Lazy-Loading enables to run EclipseStore also with low memory capacity even lower than 1 GB.
At system start, only object IDs are loaded into RAM.
Related object reference subgraphs are restored in memory on-demand only.

== EclipseStore Hello World

Using {ref-eclipsestore} is really simple.

First you have to add the dependency to your {ref-gradle} build file.

[source,groovy]
----
implementation("org.eclipse.store:storage-embedded:<current-version>")                    // <1>
implementation("org.eclipse.serializer:persistence-binary-jdk8:<current-version>")
implementation("org.eclipse.serializer:persistence-binary-jdk17:<current-version>")
----

<1> This dependency is required for the embedded storage manager.
The other dependencies are optimizations for modern Java versions.

Second, you create a storage manager and store a string as the root object to write the canonical Hello World example.

[source,java]
----
EmbeddedStorageManager storageManager = EmbeddedStorage.start();                          // <1>
storageManager.setRoot("Hello World");                                                    // <2>
storageManager.storeRoot();                                                               // <3>
----

<1> Start the database manager
<2> Set the entity (graph) as root
<3> Store root to persistent storage

== Entities and Aggregates

Domain-driven design promotes the concept of entities and aggregates.
EclipseStore optimally supports the storage and retrieval of aggregates.

The provider abstraction is a data access objects for a collection of aggregates with the same type for the root entity.

[source,java]
----
public interface Provider<T> {
    static <E extends HasOid, Long> Optional<E> findByOid(@NotNull Provider<E> provider,
            long oid) {
        return provider.findBy(E::oid, oid);
    }

    static <E extends HasId, String> Optional<E> findById(@NotNull Provider<E> provider,
            @NotNull String id) {
        return provider.findBy(E::id, id);
    }

    /**
     * Return a list containing all known instances of the entity type.
     *
     * @return list of all instances
     */
    List<T> items();

    /**
     * Update the data associated with the entity. If the entity is new, the update is handled
     * as a create operation. The update is transitive and all referenced entities are also
     * updated. The entity given as parameter becomes the instance managed through the provider.
     *
     * @param entity entity to update
     */
    void update(@NotNull T entity);

    /**
     * Delete the data associated with the entity. The object identifier is invalidated.
     *
     * @param entity entity to delete
     */
    void delete(@NotNull T entity);

    /**
     * Delete all the entities managed by the provider.
     */
    void deleteAll();


    /**
     * Replace an existing value with a new one. A null value is ignored.
     *
     * @param oldValue remove the old value if not null
     * @param newValue add the new value if not null
     */
    default void replace(T oldValue, T newValue) {
        if (Objects.nonNull(oldValue)) {
            delete(oldValue);
        }
        if (Objects.nonNull(newValue)) {
            update(newValue);
        }
    }

    /**
     * Update the data associated with all entities.
     *
     * @param items entities to update
     */
    default void updateAll(@NotNull Iterable<? extends T> items) {
        items.forEach(this::update);
    }


    /**
     * Return the first entity which property matches the value.
     *
     * @param getter getter to retrieve the property
     * @param value  value to compare with
     * @param <U>    type of the property
     * @return optional of the first matching entity otherwise empty
     */
    default <U> Optional<T> findBy(@NotNull Function<T, U> getter, U value) {
        return items().stream().filter(o -> value.equals(getter.apply(o))).findAny();
    }
}
----

Transactions must be realized at the provider level.

- Created aggregates only need transactional integrity when added to the provider.
- Deleted aggregates only need transactional integrity when removed from the provider.
- Modified aggregates need transaction integrity when updating entities and value objects of the aggregate and persisting the changes to the provider.
- Read aggregates only need transactional integrity when the aggregate is retrieved from the provider.
Potential changes to the aggregate initiated by another client can be propagated to all clients by using an event bus.

The root object for a complete bounded domain would be:

[source,java]
----
class DomainEntities {
    static class Data {                                                                   // <1>
        private final List<Lead> leads;
        private final List<NaturalEntity> naturalEntities;

        Data() {
            leads = new ArrayList<>();
            naturalEntities = new ArrayList<>();
        }
    }

    private final Data data;
    private final Provider<Lead> leads;
    private final Provider<NaturalEntity> naturalEntities;

    public DomainEntities(@NotNull Path path) {
        this.data = new Data();
        storageManager = EmbeddedStorage.start(data, path);                               // <2>

        leads = ProviderPersistence.of(storageManager, data.leads);                       // <3>
        naturalEntities = ProviderPersistence.of(storageManager, data.naturalEntities);
    }

    public Provider<Lead> leads() {                                                       // <4>
        return this.leads;
    }

    public Provider<NaturalEntity> naturalEntities() {
        return this.naturalEntities;
    }
}
----

<1> The data class contains all the data of the bounded domain.
<2> The storage manager is initialized with the data instance and the path to the storage.
The instance is populated with the persistent data if the storage exists.
<3> The provider is initialized with the storage manager and the list of entities.
<4> The provider interface is accessible through a getter.

== Advanced Considerations

For a huge set of aggregates, you should introduce a sharding concept to distribute the aggregates over multiple providers.
For example, accounting transactions can be shard by the year of the transaction date.

Beware that if an accounting transaction needs one KB of storage, a million transactions need one GB of storage.
Few companies have more than a million transactions per year.

If your bounded domain runs as a separate Java virtual machine, you should limit your memory consumption to around 32 GB.
This restriction covers a lot of concrete use cases.

Almost all internal management systems of a company can be realized within these memory limits.
You do not need to implement sophisticated sharding concepts.

== Migration tangly ERP

We migrated our open source components from {ref-microstream} to {ref-eclipsestore} as soon as the first stable release was available.
The migration was straight forward and took only a few hours.

We did not use the provided migration assistant and instead use the refactoring tools of our _IntelliJ IDEA_ IDE.

All unit tests passed without any changes.

The situation is more complicated if you have to migrate a production system with persistent data.
Our application has an export and import capability to CVS formatted files for all bounded domains
footnote:[We use the {ref-apache-commons-cvs} library for the export and import operations.].
We used this capability to export the data, migrate the application, and import the data again with the new version.

== Lessons learnt

EclipseStore is a great persistence layer for Java applications.
The effort to persist complex bounded domain object graphs is minimal.

Especially in the early phases of a project, you can focus on the domain entities and not on the persistence layer.
The integration of the {ref-eclipsestore} persistence layer is straightforward and takes only a few hours.
You can postpone the decision for the persistence layer to a later phase.

This approach is optimal for domain-driven design.

We combine EclipseStore with an in-memory file system {ref-jimfs} to create extensive integration tests with synthetic data.
The execution speed of the tests is great.
