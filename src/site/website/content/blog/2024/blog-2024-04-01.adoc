Enhance the maintainability, reliability, and observability of multithreaded code by adopting a concurrent programming style that reduces the likelihood of thread leaks and cancellation delay.
These are common risks associated with cancellation and shutdown.

Writing concurrent software is one of the greatest challenges for software developers.
Javaâ€™s thread model makes it a strong contender among concurrent languages, but multithreading has always been inherently tricky.
Structured concurrency allows you to use multiple threads with structured programming syntax.
In essence, it provides a way to write concurrent software using familiar program flows and constructs.
This lets developers focus on the business at hand, instead of the orchestration of threading.
As the JEP for structured concurrency says, "If a task splits into concurrent subtasks, then they all return to the same place, namely the task's code block."

Virtual threads, now an official feature of Java, create the possibility of cheaply spawning threads to gain concurrent performance.
Structured concurrency provides the simple syntax to do so.
As a result, Java now has a unique and highly-optimized threading system that is also easy to understand.
