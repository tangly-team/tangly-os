== Algebraic Data Types

Shallow and deep immutability

== Records

Compact

Shallow immutability

Secure serialization

== Sealed Hierarchies

Design idiom Pattern maching Compiler checks

=== Visitor Pattern Revisited

== Enumerations

Enumerations have been available since Java 5.
Enumerations are a powerful language feature to define immutable objects.
They provide secure serialization and a perfect implementation for singletons.

== Lessons Learnt

No more loops in Modern Java

No more tests on null in Modern Java.
Use optional monad.
Avoid Map and prefer records

Pattern implementation in the functional world

Immutability
