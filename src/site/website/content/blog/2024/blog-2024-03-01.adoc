Java 9 introduces a new level of abstraction above packages, known as the Java Platform Module System (JPMS), or “Modules” for short.
Modules emphasize at compilation time modern software enngineering principles such as encapsulation, and modularity

== Modules

A Module is a group of closely related packages and resources along with a new module descriptor file.

Each module is responsible for its resources, like media or configuration files.

Previously we’d put all resources into the root level of our project and manually manage which resources belonged to different parts of the application.

With modules, we can ship required images and XML files with the module that needs it, making our projects much easier to manage.

When we create a module, we include a descriptor file that defines several aspects of our new module:

=== Module Descriptor

Name:: the name of our module
Dependencies:: a list of other modules that this module depends on
Public Packages:: a list of all packages we want accessible from outside the module
Services Offered:: we can provide service implementations that can be consumed by other modules
Services Consumed:: allows the current module to be a consumer of a service
Reflection Permissions:: explicitly allows other classes to use reflection to access the private members of a package

The module naming rules are similar to how we name packages (dots are allowed, dashes are not).
It is common to do Reverse-DNS _net.tangly.mymodule_ style names.

We need to list all packages we want to be public because by default all packages are module private.

=== Module Types

There are four types of modules in the new module system:

System Modules::
These are the modules listed when we run the list-modules command above.
They include the Java SE and JDK modules.
Application Modules::
These modules are what we usually want to build when we decide to use Modules.
They are named and defined in the compiled module-info.class file included in the assembled JAR.
Automatic Modules::
We can include unofficial modules by adding existing JAR files to the module path.
The name of the module will be derived from the name of the JAR.
Automatic modules will have full read access to every other module loaded by the path.
Unnamed Module::
When a class or JAR is loaded onto the classpath, but not the module path, it’s automatically added to the unnamed module.
It’s a catch-all module to maintain backward compatibility with previously-written Java code.
