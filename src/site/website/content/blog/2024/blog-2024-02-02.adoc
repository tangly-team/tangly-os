We are an agile boutique.
We often work as Scrum master and technical agile coaches.
We often work at the customer site.

We have to ask ourselves if we should have permanent office spaces and why?

In the past, we rented dedicated office desks in a coworking space.
The place was nice.
The location was ideal for all collaborators.
The people were friendly.

We found out we were often at customer locations and had few opportunities to discuss company business in the coworking space.

The other attendees were working in different industries.
We had seldom common interests, and regularly we helped them solve their computer problems.

Honestly, I prefer to develop software at home.
The displays have higher resolution and quality.

So the coworking approach did not have a lot of advantages for us.
We decided to stop renting the office space after one year.

I do not see the purpose of having a rented office.
The office will most often be empty.
Internal meetings are seldom held in office space.
We prefer to meet in a nice coffee or at a cool location.

=== Support Various Working Models

You can work at customer site, at home, and at coworking spaces.
The decision is based on the project needs and your preferences.

This flexibility requires high-quality notebooks.
As a developer, I need a fast machine with a high-quality display.
I also like to have my own keyboard and mouse when I connect to external displays.
A programmer is more efficient with a US english keyboard and an ergonomic mouse.

As a digital nomad, I have my whole office in one traveling bag
footnote:[I am a fan of the traveller bags of timbuk2.
I owned their bags for the last twenty-five years and was always satisified with the quality and look.].

=== Nurture a Company Blog

The {ref-uri-blog} exists since the inception of the company.
We published steadily at least one article every month.
The main themes are agile approaches, technical fluency, and coaching experience.

We had the privilege to work on more than twenty product developments since the inception of the company.

The experiences and insights gained through the interactions with our customers often provided the material for articles.

The blog is a showcase hinting the capabilities, experiences and interests of our collaborators.

Interested parties read articles and can decide if our ideas match the needs and expectations they have.

We are very satisfied with the technological stack used to create and maintain the company documentation site and blog
<<creating-website>> <<support-comments>> <<improving-website>>.

The {ref-docsy} template had a major version upgrade last year.
The migration was painless und performed in less than an hour.

The community is supportive and professional.
