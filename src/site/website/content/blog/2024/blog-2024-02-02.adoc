=== Homework and work-life balance

=== Company Location

We are an agile boutique.
We have to ask ourselves if we should have permanent office spaces and why?

In the past, we rented dedicated office desks in a coworking space.
The place was nice.
The people were friendly.
I found out we were often at customer locations and had few opportunities to discuss company business in the coworking space.
The other attendees were working in different industries.
We had seldom common interests, and regularly we helped them solve their IT problems.

I prefer to develop software at home.
The displays have higher resolutionn and quality.

So the coworking approach did not have a lot of advantages for us.
We decided to stop renting the space after one year.

I do not see the purpose of having a rented office.
The office will most often be empty.
Internal meetings are seldom held in office space.
We prefer to meet in a nice coffee or at a cool location.

=== Nurture a Company Blog

The {ref-uri-blog} exists since the inception of the company.
We published steadily at least one article every month.
The main themes are agile approaches, technical fluency, and coaching experience.

The blog is a showcase hinting the capabilities, experiences and interests of our collaborators.
Interested parties read articles and can decide if our ideas match the needs and expectations they have.

We are very satisfied with the technological stack used to create and maintain the company documentation site and blog
<<creating-website>> <<support-comments>> <<improving-website>>.
The {ref-docsy} template had a major version upgrade last year.
The migration was painless und performed in less than a hour.
The community is supportive and professional.
