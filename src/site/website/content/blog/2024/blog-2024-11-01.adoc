Commercial digital applications regularly display a list of entities and details for selected one.
The selected entity can be displayed, edited, deleted.
A new entity can be created.
This pattern is called https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete[CRUD].

[TIP]
====
DDD practitioners complain that it was hard to gain commitment from business stakeholders, or even to engage them at all.
My own experience suggested that it was nearly impossible to engage business managers with UML diagrams.
It was much easier to engage them in rapid prototyping where they could see and interact with the results.

Even if you could engage the sponsors to design a domain model, by the time you have finished developing the system on top, most of its benefits had disappeared.
It is nice creating an agile domain object model, but if any change to that model also dictates the modification of layers above and underneath, then that agility is worthless.

The other concern that gave rise to the birth of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_objects[Naked Objects] was how to make user interfaces of mainstream business systems expressive.
Most business systems are not at all expressive.
They treat the user merely as a dumb process-follower, rather than as an empowered problem-solver.

Domain-driven design realized that if the domain model represents the _ubiquitous language_ of the business, those domain objects should be behaviorally rich.
Business logic is encapsulated as methods on the domain objects rather than in procedural scripts on top of them.

The next step the user interface is a reflection of the domain model.
It would make it easier to do domain-driven design, because one could easily translate evolving domain modeling ideas into a working prototype.
And it would deliver an expressive, object-oriented user interface for free.

=== Grid Display

The key concepts are filtering and ordering of the selected items per column.

=== Operations with a Selected Entity

The standard read, update, delete and create operations are supported. An additional create variant is the duplicate operation to minimize user inputs.
