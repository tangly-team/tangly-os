Entity concept for domain driven design

=== Domain Abstractions

==== Naming Domain Entities
HasOid HasId HasName

==== Temporal Information

HasTimeInterval

==== Ontology and Human Readable Information

HasTags
HasText
HasComments

=== User Interface

==== Grid List

==== Forms

==== Access Mode

View mode as readonly access to the entity information.

Edit mode as modification access to the entity information.
Modification includes edit, create, duplicate, and delete.

[NOTE]
====
In seldom cases, it is necessary to refine the modes of the application.
We have encountered a small number of systems requiring finer control.

View:: The user can only display the entity data.
Edit:: The user can modify existing data but cannot add or delete new instances.
Create:: The user can add new entities but cannot edit existing ones.
Creation is either a new object or a duplicate one.
Delete:: The suer can delete existing entities but cannot modify them or create new ones.

The defined modes support these special needs.
