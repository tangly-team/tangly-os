Modern Java applications extensively use streams.
The source code <verzichtet> to use loops and conditional statements.

The new gatherers simplify this functional and declarative programming style.

Modern IDE like IntelliJ provides reasonable support to debug complex stream expressions.
I seldom need to activate the debugger.
The declarative style tremendously reduces the risks of errors in the application.
