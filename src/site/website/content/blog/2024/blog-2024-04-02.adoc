The Java community releases a new version every six months.
This is a good thing, it means that the language is evolving at a steady pace.

New language features are added in each release.
Much effort is put into improving the performance of the JVM and solving small issues.

The community provides beta releases for developers to test and provide feedback during the six months before the next release.
You have the possibility and time to migrate and test your code before the official release.

Security vulnerabilities are patched every three months.
This is a dream for agile and DevOps teams.

Sadly, many developers are still using outdated versions of Java, which can lead to security vulnerabilities and other issues.

I try to always work with the current release of Java, but I have to admit that it is not always easy.
Below a rant about some of the issues I have encountered.
Solving these issues or finding workarounds cost me quite some hours of my time.

== IntelliJ IDEA Slow Approach

I love {ref-idea}, but it is slow to support new Java versions.
I have an ultimate license for decades and never give up the hope that they will improve their release cycle.

They almost always release a new version of IntelliJ IDEA weeks after the official release of Java.
I do not understand why they could not switch their release date to match the Java release date.

The early access program for Java should empower them to test their IDE with the new Java version before the official release.

_At least they provide preview support for some of the new JDK features in the current version of IntelliJ IDEA._

== Gradle Collapse

{ref-gradle} is my preferred build tool.

Gradle community is not capable of delivering a new version of Gradle supporting the current JDK version for months after the official release.
The reason is they use old versions of Groovy and Kotlin instead of regularly updating with the current stable versions.

_Yes, you can run Gradle with an older version of Java and compile the code with a newer version of Java._
_It makes your GitHub actions more complex and brittle._
The standard GitHub scripts do not support installing multiple JDK versions in the image building your application
footnote:[If you have a code snippet for a {ref-github} build script, let me know.
The script shall install multiple JDKs, run Gradle with an older version, and let the Gradle toolchain find the current JDK to build the code.
I will add your solution with your name in this blog and star your snippet on {ref-github}.]
footnote:[Gradle 8.8 was released 31^st^ May 2024. It is the first version to run on Java 22.
Java 22 was released 19^th^ March 2024, almost two and a half months ago.].

== JPMS Laggards

I cannot fully modularize my applications due to the lack of support for JPMS in many libraries.

{ref-jpms} is available since Java 9. This version was released on September 21, 2017.
Maintainers had *seven* years to migrate their code to JPMS.
The minimal effort is to provide an automatic name.

_You have to write one line in your manifest file of your jar file to support JPMS._

The {ref-asciidoctorj} package has still no automatic name.
Some Apache libraries have no automatic names.
A lot of well-known libraries do not document the automatic name in their documentation.

== Javalin Debacle

I like the {ref-javalin} REST framework.
It is a small and lightweight web framework and uses the {ref-jetty} as embedded server.
It has build-in support for {ref-openapi}

The team quite screwed up the migration to the current Jetty version released more than one year ago.
_Developers should not use internal Jetty classes in their code
footnote:[If {ref-jetty} would use JPMS, they could hide these classes inside a module.
No external developers could use them.]._

I develop applications with {ref-vaadin} and {ref-javalin}.
A cool developer Martin Vysny has created a nice library {ref-vaadin-boot} to integrate both frameworks.
The {ref-vaadin} application uses an embedded {ref-jetty} server and can be deployed as a single jar file.
The whole setup is about 20 lines of code.
It is a pleasure to work with this library.

Now Javalin hinders the use of the current Jetty version
footnote:[Martin has found a workaround, but the drawback is that we have to use a quite older version of Javalin.].

== Good Practices

I understand that open source developers have limited resources to migrate their code to the current Java version.
I find the practice advocated by Brian Goetz ideal.

. Support the latest LTS version of Java in your stable release.
. All new development and improvements should be done with the current Java version.
. Do not support any other Java versions.
Provide a package for the current Java version and a package for the latest LTS version.
Do not backport any new features to the LTS version.
Remember, a new LTS version is released every two years.
Fix painful bugs.
. You have no excuse not to define an automatic name for your library.

[TIP]
====
Today you shall only support JDK 21 LTS and JDK 22.

The early access program for JDK 23 is available.
You can already test your code with JDK 23.
====

The huge advantage is that you only have to maintain two versions of your code.
You focus on developing new features only with the current Java version.
No need to backport any new features to the LTS version.

Because all new features are only available with the current Java version, your users have a strong motivation to migrate to the current Java version.

_As a developer, it is more fun to write code with the latest Java version and use the latest features._

_Please remember never to use internal classes of a library in your code_.
_It will bite you_.

_Update your JDK every three months to install the latest security patches._

_Continuously update your dependencies to the latest stable version._ +
_{ref-gradle} has plugins and {ref-github} has dependabot to simplify or automate the work._
_You need a continuous integration pipeline and sufficient automatic tests to validate your code with the latest dependencies._
