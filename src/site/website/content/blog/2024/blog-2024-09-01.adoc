=== In-Memory Application

All application data is loaded in-memory using the MicroStream

=== Grid Sorting and Filtering

=== Vaadin Component Factory

[TIP]
====
Consultants often condemn server-side solutions.
They declare these solutions not scalable and useable in a productive context.

I concur that it would not be possible to implement Twitter with this approach.
But how much memory does a Vaadin application need?

Experiments show that around 9'000 parallel users require 1 GB of RAM.
A small server has easily 4 GB and would handle more than 30'000 parallel users without any problem.

Be honest.
The solutions we are developing seldom have more than a few hundreds of concurrent users.
Very few deployed applications have more than 5'000 users.

=== Authentication and Authorization

=== Internationalization and Localization
