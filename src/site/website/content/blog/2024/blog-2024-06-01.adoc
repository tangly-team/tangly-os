=== Daily Scrum

The official definition of the Daily Scrum as stated in the {ref-scrumguide} is:

_The purpose of the Daily Scrum is *to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal* and adapt the Sprint Backlog as necessary, adjusting the upcoming planned work._

_The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute event for the Developers of the Scrum Team._
_To reduce complexity, it is held at the same time and place every working day of the Sprint._
_If the Product Owner or Scrum Master are actively working on items in the Sprint Backlog, they participate as Developers._

_The Developers can select *whatever structure and techniques they want*, as long as their Daily Scrum focuses on progress toward the Sprint Goal and produces an actionable plan for the next day of work._
_This creates focus and improves self-management._

_Daily Scrums improve communications, identify impediments, promote quick decision-making, and consequently eliminate the need for other meetings._

_The Daily Scrum is *not* the only time Developers are allowed to adjust their plan._
_*They often meet throughout the day for more detailed discussions about adapting or re-planning the rest of the Sprintâ€™s work.*_

=== Daily Scrum Questions

. Can we achieve the Sprint Goal?
. Do we have to change the content of the Sprint Backlog to achieve the Sprint Goal?
. Who needs help?
. Who will pair with me today?
. Where do we need to swarm today?
. Do we have any blockers?
. What should we drop to focus on the highest priority?
. Shall we reduce WIP?
. Appreciation time for provided help. why wait until the Retrospective?
. What were the biggest learnings in this Sprint?
. Start with a quote about software engineering or agile!

A great Scrum master shall make his teams aware of the true goal of a daily Scrum meeting

Avoid doing Scrum, ask yourself how to be agile and continuously improve.

Motivate your collaborators to read the {ref-scrumguide}.
Support continuous formation.
Certification does not proof deep knowledge.
But at least you have learnt the definition and read historical and important texts.
