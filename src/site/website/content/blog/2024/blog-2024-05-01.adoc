A solution architecture document _SAD_ is a document that describes the structure of a software solution.

It includes the architecture of its components, the relationships between those components, and the principles that guide its design.

The solution architecture document is typically used as a reference for designing, building, and maintaining a software system.

Developers, architects, and other stakeholders use it to understand the overall design of the system and how it fits into the larger business or technical environment.

Modern software development practices, such as agile and DevOps, have changed the way we think about software architecture

Tooling and practices have evolved to support the creation of lightweight, agile software architecture documentation.
{ref-arc42} natively supports Asciidoc and Markdown based documentation.
All documents are stored as text artifacts in a git repository.
The documentation is generated as static website {ref-asciidoc}.
Diagrams with {ref-c4} or {ref-uml}, {ref-adr} are linked to source code documentation.

Software architecture documentation creates a common understanding.
Software architecture documentation creates a common understanding of the solution behind the system for various stakeholders.
The documentation makes it possible to evaluate the software architecture from the perspective of the various stakeholders.
Software architecture documentation supports architectural work.
Software architecture documentation guides the development team in implementing new product features.

You should understand as a software architect:

- The essence of software architecture.
- Why should the software architecture role include coding, coaching and collaboration?
- The things that you really need to think about before coding.
- How to visualize your software architecture using {ref-c4}?
- A lightweight approach to documenting your software.
- Why there is no conflict between agile and architecture?
- What does _just enough_ upfront design mean?
- How to identify risks with risk-storming?

== Documentation Rules

These are the rules for any technical documentation, including software architecture documentation:

. Write documentation from the readerâ€™s point of view.
. Document that you have realized, not your wishes.
. Avoid unnecessary repetition.
Minimalism is key.
. Avoid ambiguity.
. Use a standard organization such as {ref-arc42}.
. Record rationale and decisions with {ref-adr}.
. Keep documentation current but not too current.
Generate your documentation as a static website.
. Review documentation for fitness of purpose.

Upfront document everything::
Do not document everything in advance.
Think of the arc42 template as a cabinet for documentation. +
You put something on a shelf as you work on it.
This is how software architecture documentation emerges, evolves, and stays current.
Do not include tutorials or Q&A sections::
The most important thing in arc42 is the structure.
The structure does not provide a space for guides or Q&A sections.
Do not put any specific things like customer names or similar::
Do not write customer-specific things in the software architecture documentation unless your building blocks are structured in a customer-oriented way.
Do not generate documentation site::
Manual activities to generate the product documentation are a waste of time.
Modern approaches are documentation as code and static site generators. +
{ref-github} and {ref-gitlab} provide the _pages_ feature to host your documentation as static website.
The generation can be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.
