A solution architecture document is a document that describes the structure of a software solution, including the architecture of its components, the relationships between those components, and the principles that guide its design.
The solution architecture document is typically used as a reference for designing, building, and maintaining a software system.
It is used by developers, architects, and other stakeholders to understand the overall design of the system and how it fits into the larger business or technical environment.

Software architecture documentation creates a common understanding.
Software architecture documentation creates a common understanding of the solution behind the system for various stakeholders.
The documentation makes it possible to evaluate the software architecture from the perspective of the various stakeholders.
Software architecture documentation supports architectural work.
Software architecture documentation guides the development team in implementing new product features.

You should understand as a software architect:

- The essence of software architecture.
- Why the software architecture role should include coding, coaching and collaboration?
- The things that you really need to think about before coding.
- How to visualise your software architecture using {ref-c4}?
- A lightweight approach to documenting your software.
- Why there is no conflict between agile and architecture?
- What "just enough" up front design means?
- How to identify risks with risk-storming?

=== Documentation Rules

These are the rules for any technical documentation, including software architecture documentation:

. Write documentation from the reader’s point of view.
. Avoid unnecessary repetition.
. Avoid ambiguity.
. Use a standard organization.
. Record rationale.
. Keep documentation current but not too current.
. Review documentation for fitness of purpose.

=== Possible Pitfalls

Upfront document everything::
Don't document everything in advance.
Think of the arc42 template as a cabinet for documentation.
You put something on a shelf as you work on it.
This is how software architecture documentation emerges, evolves, and stays current.
Don't includes Tutorials or Q&A sections::
The most important thing in arc42 is the structure.
The structure doesn’t provide a space for guides or Q&A sections.
Don't put any specific things like customer names or similar::
Don't write customer-specific things in the software architecture documentation, unless your building blocks are structured in a customer-oriented way.
