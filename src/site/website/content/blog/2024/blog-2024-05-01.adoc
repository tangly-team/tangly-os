A solution architecture document is a document that describes the structure of a software solution, including the architecture of its components, the relationships between those components, and the principles that guide its design.
The solution architecture document is typically used as a reference for designing, building, and maintaining a software system.
It is used by developers, architects, and other stakeholders to understand the overall design of the system and how it fits into the larger business or technical environment.
