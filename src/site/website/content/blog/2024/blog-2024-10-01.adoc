https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design[Domain-driven design] is a tremendous good practice for modern agile software architecture
cite:[domain-driven-design,domain-driven-design-distilled,implementing-domain-driven-design].

The approach is used to design modular monoliths.
The digital solution can evolve to a full-fledged microservices architecture if the market requires the associated scalability and resilience.

The approach enables parallel development with multiple agile teams.
DDD approach encourages the clear definition of minimal interfaces between bounded domains.

Continuous integration, delivery and deployment validate delivered increments.
The teams have the guaranty the integrated solution is working as expected.

DevOps culture shortens work in progress _WIP_ <<introducing-devops-ideas>> <<devops-for-small-applications>> <<first-steps-devops>>.

=== Domain Entities

A key concept in the approach is the concept of entities.
An entity is a representation of an object in the domain.

It is defined by its identity, continuity, and persistence over time rather than its attributes.

It encapsulates the state of that object through its attributes, including the aggregation of other entities.
It defines any operations that might be performed on the entity.

What is the identity of an instance in your system?

We identified three regular concepts of identities in digital solutions <<meaningful-identifiers>> <<identifiers-and-names>>.

Internal Identity::
An instance is identified through an internal object identifier _OID_.
The application is owner of this internal identifier.
An internal identifier should stay internal and not be sent to other systems. +
_An example is the company internal collaborator identifier._
External Identity::
An instance is identified through an external object identifier _ID_.
The application or another external system is owner of the external identifier for a type of entities. +
_An example is the social security number of a collaborator_.
Name::
An instance can at least partially be identified through a human friendly name.
The application or another external system is owner of the name for a type of entities. +
_An example is the full name of a collaborator_.

package net.tangly.core;

interface HasOid {
    long oid();
}

interface HasId {
    String id();
    void id(String id);
}

interface HasName {
    String name();
    void name(String name);
}

[TIP]
====
Entities should only have external identifiers in an ideal bounded domain.
External identifiers are natural ones and part of the domain.

Internal object identifiers are a technical solution for incomplete domain entities.
Incomplete often means that the digitalization of your bounded domain is hindered.

For example, in Switzerland it was long prohibited to use the social security number as identifier for natural persons.
The federal government has change the laws in 2022. But you still cannot access the social number of children.
The identifier is defined but is not accessible.

Therefore, you are forced to create an internal identifier to uniquely identify natural persons in Switzerland.
Similar difficulties exist in Europe to access the European natural person identifier
footnote:[Naturally, the Swiss social number is not compatible with the European one to spice-up your modeling problems.
An example of well-defined external identifier is the plate number of a car.
This identifier is valid worldwide.].
====

Entities often have temporal information associated with them.
This information describes the continuity of an instance.

We identified two major temporal attributes of entities:

Creation Date::
The date when an entity was created. +
_An example is the creation date of an invoice._
Temporal Scope::
The temporal range when an entity is active.
The start date or the end date of the scope can be optional. +
_An example is the start and end of a collaborator work contract An active work contract has a start date but no end date._
_Another interesting temporal range is the validity range of currencies.
The introduction of the Euro was the end of quite a few currencies_

[source,java]
----
package net.tangly.core;

interface HadDate {
    LocalDate date();
    void date(LocalDate date);
}

interface HasTimeInterval {
    LocalDate from();
    void from(LocalDate from);
    LocalDate to();
    void to(LocalDate to);
}
----

Users often want to access human-readable information to better understand an instance <<power-of-tags>>.
They also want to classify groups of entities.

Textual Description::
A textual description of the entity to provide context and user related information.
Comments::
Comments are user-specific notes describing various aspects of an entity.
Comments are unstructured.
he software does not generally process them.
Tags::
Tags define a customer-specific ontology to classify entities in their system.
Tags without value are equivalent to labels.
Tags with optional or mandatory values enrich the classification information with instance-specific parameter values.

We support {ref-asciidoc} syntax for all textual elements.
The feature hugely improves the legibility and attractiveness of textual description for the users.

[source,java]
----
package net.tangly.core;

interface HasText {
    String text();
    void text(String text);
}

interface HasComments {
    List<Comment> comments();
    void add(@NotNull Comment comment);
    void addComments(@NotNull Iterable<Comment> comments);
    void remove(@NotNull Comment comment);
}

interface HasTags {
    Set<Tag> tags;
    boolean add(@NotNull Tag tag);
    void addTags(@NotNull Iterable<Tag> tags);
    boolean remove(@NotNull Tag tag);
    void removeAllTags();
}
----

The entity abstraction wraps the above mixins and introduces the concept of validating an instance.

[source,java]
----
package net.tangly.core;

interface Entity extends HasOid, HasId, HasName, HasText, HasTimeInterval, HasTags, HasComments {
    boolean validate();
}
----

=== User Interface

Your user wants to see and manipulate domain entities.

The entities of a specific type shall be displayed in a grid.
The relevant properties are displayed in associated columns.

Your user needs to select the entities he is interested in.
We provide filtering and ordering for the displayed columns.
The filter conditions are additive.

A form is provided to display the details of an instance.
The same form is provided for editing purposes.

View mode as readonly access to the entity information.

Edit mode as modification access to the entity information.
Modification includes edit, create, duplicate, and delete.

[NOTE]
====
In seldom cases, it is necessary to refine the modes of the application.
We have encountered a small number of systems requiring finer control.

List:: The user can only view the grid and properties displayed in the grid.
All other modes have access to the grid and the form representation for the selected item in the grid.
View:: The user can only display the entity data.
Edit:: The user can modify existing data but cannot add or delete new instances.
Create:: The user can add new entities but cannot edit existing ones.
Creation is either the definition of all properties of a new object or the edition of the values of a duplicate one.
Delete:: The user can delete existing entities but cannot modify them or create new ones.

The defined modes support these special requirements.
====

The three most used modes are _list_, _view_, and _edit_.

The domain entity user interface <<domain-entities-ui>> discuss the implementation of the CRUD approach in more details.

=== Lessons Learnt

The compactness of the code necessary to create a complete CRUD user interface is very high.
We found out writing such code is more efficient than using model driven approaches.
Therefore, we decided to ditch frameworks such as https://www.openxava.org/en/[openXava] or Apache https://causeway.apache.org/[Causeway].
The gains for using these frameworks are too small to justify the learning curve and implicit limitations of such libraries.

The ideas behind these frameworks and also promoted through domain-driven design are still worth learning how to apply them in your products.
