I work with European and Swiss companies.
Regularly, some of them are slightly paranoid and deny access to cloud services.

You cannot use well-established software development platforms such as {ref-github}, {ref-gitlab}, or {ref-bitbucket}.
The price per developer and year is around 250 Euro.
You get the whole set of functions and goodies such as single sign-or and auditing of all activities.

The same companies are not able to provide financial and technical resources to build a similar onsite offer.

The development teams have no access to modern source code management or build pipelines.

How can you efficiently work in such a retrograde environment?

We present pragmatic recipes to alleviate the damage and help your team to work productively in such environments.

You need a virtual machine or a physical workstation with reasonable memory, processor, and persistent storage resources.
You must have local administration rights in this environment.
Ideally, you should have a reasonable domain name to access the machine or at least a fix internal IP address.
footnote:[It is still possible to work with an IP address.
You can try to add a record on the localhost file on each developer workstation.
If it is not possible, your team will have to memorize the IP address.].

The key functions we shall provide are:

- source code management
- continuous integration, delivery, and deployment pipelines
- artifact management
- website with searchable and versioned documentation
- basic project management and communication tools for team tasks and issues

=== Source Code Management

{ref-git}
{ref-forgejo} is a self-hosted lightweight software forge
footnote:[You could also use https://gitea.com/[Gitea].].
Easy to install and low maintenance, it just does the job.

If you like any of the following features, Forgejo is literally meant for you:

Lightweight::
Forgejo can easily be hosted on nearly every machine.
Project management::
Besides Git hosting, Forgejo offers issues, pull requests, wikis, kanban boards and much more to coordinate with your team.
Publishing::
Have something to share?
Use releases to host your software for download, or use the package registry to publish it for docker, npm and many other package managers.
Customizable::
Want to change your look?
Change some settings?
There are many config switches to make Forgejo work exactly like you want.
Powerful::
Organizations and team permissions, CI integration, Code Search, LDAP, OAuth and much more.
If you have advanced needs, Forgejo has you covered.
Privacy::
From an update checker to default settings. Forgejo is built to be privacy first for you and your crew.

=== Continuous Integration, Delivery, and Deployment

Modern software development approaches require access to a continuous build pipeline.
Either you write your own approach using build script and docker images, or you use a service.

{ref-forgejo} provides access to an experimental build server.
You can also use other open source solutions such as https://woodpecker-ci.org/[Woodpecker].
Commercial products such as https://www.jenkins.io/[Jenkins], https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/[TeamCity], or
https://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo/[Bamboo] are naturally available for decades.

=== Artifact management

Artifact server is used to store the artifacts created during the delivery activities in the pipeline.

The {ref-forgejo} application provides support for a set of artifact managers.
There is no need to install an additional server to service package requests.

=== Documentation

[INFO]
====
Beware of the drawbacks of wiki approaches.
Wiki based solutions are very easy to deploy.

Wiki often the following problems:

- It is cumbersome or difficult to version the content of a wiki site.
You want to deploy the documentation associated with a specific release of your application.
You often need multiple wiki versions at the same time to support the delivered version, the version under testing and the version under active development.
- Support for diagramming in the wiki pages is often limited or only available through commercial plugins.
{ref-asciidoctor} support more than thirty https://docs.asciidoctor.org/diagram-extension/latest/[diagram types] out of the box.
Source code highlighting for huge range of programming languages is also available in {ref-asciidoc}
- You must use a wiki supporting storing all contents in a git repository.
You need the tracking and versioning features of a source code management solution.
====

=== Project Management Services

You need basic functions to work using agile approaches.
If a team is working in the same location, use an analog board as a sprint board.

The issues can be tracked with a tool like {ref-forgejo} if you really need the additional functionality.
The solution provides a minimal kanban board for geographically distributed teams.

=== Tips and Tricks

The bare minimum of services you need is a git repository, a possibility to build your software in a clean environment, and a site to publish your documentation.

For each service you deploy, you must implement a backup strategy.
The easiest approach is to regularly archive the project data and save on a company network drive.
Often the amount of data for an initiative is less than one GB.
Bigger projects are below 10 GB.
Remember your artifacts are text files, not huge office documents or binary files.
