I am an engineer.
I love to solve problems and provide cool solutions
cite:[facts-and-fallacies-software-engineering].

I love my software development job.
I am sixty years old.
I started programming before I was 20.
And I still tremendously love developing digital products and writing programs.
Tinkering on source code to have a maintainable and efficient solution is my passion.

I love technology and to work improving live quality for humanity.

I love to develop software and see how it helps customers.

I am so grateful for GPS navigation and maps on my mobile telephone.
I never had to print any route to a new customer or to my holiday hostel in the last two decades.
The mobile app guides me effortless to my destination.

This is progress.

== Software Engineer

I found out the only drawback of my job in Switzerland.
It is challenging to get hired as a software developer when you are older than fifty.
The Swiss companies are bigot and prefer to hire young people.

I seldom encounter active developers my age in the companies I work for.
Managers think that older developers are not productive anymore.

Surprisingly, I easily found jobs as an independent contractor.
So if founded {ref-tangly} in 2015.
Our agile and Java boutique is quite successful since then.

I love designing and writing software using modern approaches
cite:[domain-driven-design,building-evolutionary-architectures-2ndworking-effectively-with-legacy-code,refactoring-2nd].

My preferred technology stacks are modern Java and modular monolith applications.

== Teacher and Coach

I regularly complain that quite a few software developers are not well-trained.
I have therefore to actively initiate a change.

I love to teach students at technical universities and coach software engineers.

I found it incredibly rewarding to observe talented developers grasping advanced software engineering concepts
cite:[modern-software-engineering].
Ideally, these coachees are someday better than I.

== Entrepreneur

A professional software engineer considers various aspects when developing a digital product
cite:[phoenix-project,unicorn-project].

- The functional requirements to ensure that _you build the right product_.
- The non-functional requirements to ensure that _you build the product right_.
- Corporate governance, legal, social and ethical constraint to ensure that _you build a good product_.
- Financial considerations to ensure that _you create a sellable product_.

I thrive in the entrepreneurial aspects of financial and legal constraints necessary for a successful product
