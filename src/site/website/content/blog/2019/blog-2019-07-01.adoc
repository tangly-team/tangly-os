The world has really improved in a lot of areas.

_Stop whining we are doomed. And yes we must act strong and fast to tackle the climate change disaster._

But do not forget how much the world *bettered* the last centuries.

We are not doomed, we must solve the next challenges instead of just complaining and doing nothing.

* Ask yourself if you need a car.
* Travel with train instead of flying.
* Schedule a video conference instead of a business trip.
* Reduce your plastic and paper usage.
* Each step reduces your carbon footprint.

Millions of persons taking similar steps will be a huge improvement. *Just do it!*

The late Swedish academic https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Rosling[Hans Rosling] has identified a worrying trend.
Not only do many people across advanced economies have no idea that the world is becoming a much better place, but they actually even think the opposite.
This is no wonder, when the news focuses on reporting catastrophes, terrorist attacks, wars and famines.

Who wants to hear about the fact that every day some *200'000* people around the world are lifted above the $2-a-day poverty line?
Or that more than *300'000* people a day get access to electricity and clean water for the first time every day?
These stories of people in low-income countries simply doesn’t make for exciting news coverage.

=== What is better?

==== Extreme poverty is plumping down

Please stop the doomsday trashing and start to act to improve your social environment and diminish your solution footprint.
I am tired hearing we cannot improve our world.
Stop lying and simply look at the facts.
Feel free to argument based on facts.

I recognize that we have difficult problems to solve and success is not guaranteed.
I am just tired of negative thinking and persons claiming we cannot improve our world.
