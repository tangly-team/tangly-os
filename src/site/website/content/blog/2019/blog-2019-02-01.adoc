You are developing your applicaion using agile and lean approaches.

How can you check your approach and distill improvements?
A health check of your product and your development approach is certainly a good solution.

This post is the fourth and last of a set of articles identifying health checks with different focus.
We will identify strengths, potential weaknesses and hopefully find room for improvement.

What is your company culture and how does it focus collaborators to delight your customers.

=== Rules

The patient solely decides if a health check shall be performed.
The effort and depth of a health check is defined together with the patient.
The findings are considered confidential.

[quote, Jurgen Appelo]

Many attempts at achieving business agility are misguided and fake. But I consider the glass half full, not half empty.

Fake Agile is a signal to do better. Fake agile is a treatable disorder.

A short check with a feedback workshop presenting the insights requires around two work days.
A deeper and more intensive check requests more effort, between one and four weeks.
Upon completion you can also hire a coach to implement selected findings and improve durably the health of your application.
The findings are often clear and the measures straightforward.
The real work is to implement consistently the measures.

I have the same personal challenge when trying to loose weight or improve my running form.
The long term implementation is the crux.

=== Company Culture Checks

The biggest flag to identify a learning and improvement focused culture is perhaps this statement

Not only training on the job, but they send them to courses, exhibitions and buy them books.
