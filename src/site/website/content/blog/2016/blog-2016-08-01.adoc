I learnt quite a few new acronyms and techniques when studying for the PMI-ACP certification program.
In this post I collected these acronyms, some definition and the bibliography you should know before attending the examination.

The main advantage of having it is that you no more need to argue with PMI certified product managers if agile is applicable to software projects.

The main interest of PMI-ACP certification is their collection of concepts taken from Agile, eXtreme Programming, Scrum and Lean.

It could be worth your money to buy the book "The PMI-ACP Exam: How to pass on Your First Try", Andy Crowe, First Edition 2012.
The book itself is not rocket science but it contains two hundreds questions which are similar to the ones you will encounter during the examination.

To get your 21 PDUs necessary for the examination you must attend a training course.
I booked an online course at Simplilearn for a reasonable price.
The content was reasonable.
The test questions were good.

The renewal of the certification again requires PDUs.
I took an online training in interesting areas such as coaching techniques, how to manage effective and efficient meetings or how to write good protocols.
Some online videos of https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog[Mike Cohn] also count for PDUs.

** EV (Earned Value) = BAC (Budget At Completion) \* Actual Percentage Completed - Sum (PV[Completed]) from start until current
** CPI (Cost Performance Index) = EV / AC (Actual Cost) indicates if we are under or other budget
** SPI (Schedule Performance Index) = PV / AC indicates if we are early or late

* RUP Rational Unified Process: Inception, Elaboration, Construction, Transition phases
* Staging: The process of defining and prioritizing the nonfunctional requirements for scaling is called staging.
 Staging occurs prior to the start of the first sprint and takes just one day.
 During this day, the nonfunctional scaling requirements for this particular product are determined and placed in the Product Backlog.

Below some additional definitions

[quote, Norm Kerth's Prime Directive (should be used in review and retrospective) ]
____
Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills
and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand.
____

* Story Points versus Ideal Days - and Elapsed Days -
* Crystal Clear requires
** the following properties:
*** Frequent delivery of usable code to users
*** Reflective improvement
*** Osmotic http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication[communication] preferably by being co-located
** Crystal Clear additionally includes these optional properties:
*** Personal safety
*** Focus
*** Easy access to expert users
*** Automated tests, configuration management, and frequent integration
* Agile Coach Failure Modes: Spy, Seagull, Opinionated, Admin, Hub, Butterfly, Expert
* Root-causing a defect or testing the feasibility of an algorithm or a third party solution is an example of a spike
* Measure: ascertain the size, amount, or degree of (something) by using an instrument or device marked in standard units or by comparing it with an object of known size
* Dysfunctional teams pyramid: absence of trust, fear of conflict, lack of commitment, avoidance of accountability, inattention to results
* According to DeMarco, Fragmented knowledge workers may look busy but a lot of their business is just thrashing. The minimum cost penalty is 15%
* The declaration milestone is a verbal notice from one person to another, or to multiple people, that a milestone was reached.
* The three coach styles are Teaching, Coaching, and Advising.
* Quantity of function is, scope, measured in terms of user stories, use cases, requirements, or features (depending on a particular situation).
 In software, these may be measured ultimately as objects, modules, classes, or lines of code.

=== Questions

* Which of the following correctly defines the team members themselves managing assignment of the day-to-day tasks required to deliver stories at the end of
each iteration? _Workload Management_
* Which of the following technique can be used to apply to bring down the Lost Opportunity Cost within your team? _Team Collocation_
* When should the Product Owner provide feedback on the work results? _Just in time reviews_
* Who is the most appropriate person to monitor all the risks in an Agile product? _The product manager_
* Which of the following is false about Velocity? _Velocity cannot correct Estimation errors_
* Which of the following is NOT the skill for Agile coaches for facilitating change? _Reaching agreement_
* Which tool combines the estimation techniques of expert opinion, disaggregation and analogy?
_Planning poker combines expert opinion, analogy, and disaggregation into an enjoyable approach to estimating that results in quick but reliable estimates._
* Which of the following metrics can be BEST standardized across teams?
_Business case realization -The PMO can help the teams to enable timely decision making by standardizing the metrics.-_
* Which is the communication technique where you repeat back a summary of what the other person just said to you to confirm understanding?
_Reflective Listening is a communication technique where you repeat back a summary of what the other person just said to you to confirm understanding._
_Another benefit in this situation is that having the person hear their own ideas in another person’s voice/words may make it easier for them to be objective._
* Adaptation depends upon understanding a wide range of information, including an assessment of the product's progress, technical risks, the requirements
evolution, and ongoing competitive market analysis. Which are the areas where every team needs to constantly evaluate and make appropriate adaptations ?
_Product Value, Product quality, Product status, Team performance -Every team needs to constantly evaluate and make appropriate adaptations in the following four areas - Product Value, Product quality, Product status, Team performance-_
* A standard for measuring or evaluating something. _Metric - A metric is a standard for measuring or evaluating something.-_
* What BEST describes the characteristics of a Learner at Level 3 or in the Fluent stage of learning?
 Learners in the Fluent stage are experts -The Stage 3 Learner is at the stage of mastery.
 He is able to figure out the end effect of any procedure and to make his way to that end.-
* Scrum uses the sashimi technique to require that every slice of functionality created by the developers be complete.
 All the requirements gathering and analysis, design work, coding, testing, and documentation that constitute a complete product are required to be completed
 in every Sprint and demonstrated in the Sprint increment of functionality. Sprints are kept short enough that the stakeholders don’t lose interest in the
 product before the Sprints are completed. And stakeholders can see that they have an opportunity to redirect the product at the start of every Sprint to
 optimize the value they derive from the product. At the end of every Sprint, stakeholders see new functionality. Models, requirements, and internal
 artefacts might be of use to the developers, but they are never shown to the stakeholders.
* Feature X has a value of 12 and the total value of all features is 35. If the feature is estimated to cost 56%, what is the priority of this feature using
 relative weighting?
 _Correct Answer is B. The priority of the feature is determined by dividing the relative value by the cost %. Hence the answer = (12/35)/(0.56) = 0.61._
* The 100-Point Method was originally developed by Dean Leffingwell and Don Widrig for use cases and is used for prioritization as well.
 It is a voting scheme where each stakeholder is given 100 points that he or she can use for voting in favour of the most important requirements.
 How they distribute the 100 points is up to them: 20 here, 10 there or even all 100 on a single requirement if that is their sole priority.
* When a team member approaches the Coach with a complaint about another team member, what conflict resolution technique should the Coach use?
 _Three-step intervention path_
 Every team needs to constantly evaluate and make appropriate adaptations in the following four areas: Product value, Product quality, Team performance,
 Project status.
* Normative methodologies are based on solutions or sequences of steps known to work for the discipline.
 Electrical and other building codes in house wiring are examples.
 In software development, one would include state diagram verification in this category.
* Iterative development means that we build a partial version of a product and then expand that version through successive short time periods of development
 followed by reviews and adaptations. Feature-based delivery means that the engineering team builds features of the final product or, particularly with
 industrial products. At least a close representation of the final product (such as a simulation model). Iterations are constrained to produce a result within
 a certain period of time—a time box (as short as 1–4 weeks for software). Time boxes force closure; they force us to make something concrete, often before
 we are quite ready. Incremental development means that we build these products such that they could be deployed at the end of one or more of the iterations.
* Forecasting the financial value of a theme is the responsibility of the product owner, but it is a responsibility shared with all other team
 members—programmers, testers, analysts, product managers, and so on.
* Decision Framing focuses majorly on,
_Decision framing focuses on who gets involved in the decision process._
_Managers who make decisions without input from subordinates and peers make poor decisions._
_Engineers who make decisions without input from managers and peers make poor decisions._
_Who makes the decision is less important than getting the right people involved in the decision process._
* Which of the following charts shows the total number of story points completed through the end of each iteration? _Cumulative story point burn-down chart_
* During a critical problem solving, you can ask probing questions, use active and reflective listening, Lead to an answer but one should avoid injecting their
own ideas.

I wish you success for your certification.
