I often hear discussions who is doing the _traditional_ product leader tasks in Scrum.
This is in general an excuse to state that Scrum alone cannot work and classical product leaders are still needed.

Below a list of tasks you do NOT need anymore to do in {ref-scrum}.

* Make commitments on behalf of the team about how much they can get done by a certain date or estimate effort for the team,
* Coerce the team that the commitments made on their behalf are attainable,
* Coerce the team to change their estimates,
* Give direction to the team on how to implement the work,
* Monitor the team's progress to make sure they stay on schedule,
* Step in and determine the solution,
* Conduct weekly status update and face to face meetings with the team to surface issues and provide direction,
* Provide motivation and push the team to work harder than they might want to using carrots and sticks,
* Decide task assignments among the team members and follow up on tasks to verify completion. Force them to work during weekends,
* Be responsible for the team doing the right thing at the right time in the right way,
* Update Gantt charts for the iteration and release planning,
* Finding out that requirements mean to explain team members what they should implement,
* Review the documents and code to guaranty quality,
* Explain upper management why the product is late and why you need additional resources,
* Explain upper management why you cannot transfer a team member to another product,
* Attend weekly progress and escalation meetings to explain in details the status of your product,
* Define the priority of the next activities.

Now you as Scrum master or agile product manager have to perform important tasks

* Help removing impediments to increase velocity of team
* Coach team to implement Scrum and reflect on their activities.
* {ref-pdca} _PDCA_ principle is built into Scrum with retrospectives and sprint reviews.
* Coach product owner to deliver a groomed and refined backlog
* Inform and support all product's stakeholders
* If you reflect on these two lists it becomes obvious that the first list describes malfunctions and the second one describes mechanisms how to improve continuously - lean principles -.

Jeff Sutherland gives some interesting insights about the Scrum master

* The Scrum master enforces Scrum practices _Coaching rather than command and control_
* The Scrum master effort is
** Few problems: for a small team 10%, for a large team 50% of your working time,
** Many problems: for a small team 50%, for a large team 100% of your working time until the team reaches a flow status,
** A Scrum master is a change agent and supports the organization to become more agile.

I experimented with the Scrum master being part of the team, or Scrum master working for multiple teams.
Experience has shown us that the full-time Scrum master is more effective.

And the {ref-less} framework has a clear rule about product managers

For all https://www.pmi.org/[Project Management Institute] +PMI_ fans, the institute has acquired _Disciplined Agile Delivery_ _DAD_ in 2019.
The PMI-ACP is working on integrating agile approaches in the official PMI approach.
