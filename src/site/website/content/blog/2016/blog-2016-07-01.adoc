You are working in a small collocated development team and decided to use branches to implement new features or fix errors.

Here the cookbook to create, edit, merge and delete local and remote branches in {ref-git} (version 2.x).
Git branches have two important qualities.

* A branch is like an idea.
Once you implemented the idea, feature or fix you just merge back to trunk and delete the branch.
* The history of the branch commits is still visible upon deletion of the branch.

[NOTE]
====
In an agile working setup, a branch should be merged before the end of the sprint it was started.

Stories should be completed inside a sprint time slot.
====

_You should use meaningful names for your branch name and associated commit messages._
_Put the ticket number into the branch name and messages for future searches._

[TIP]
====
A lot of servers support keywords such as _fix #42_ to automatically close ticket 42.
====

The described approach is optimal for small teams.
The approach is compatible to pull requests if you introduce such a workflow later.
You do not need to pull requests when you are working collocated.
I prefer pair programming and pair check-in sessions against the trunk.

For a short introduction to how to start using Git in software projects, see the blog
link:../../2017/git-local-repositories-for-the-impatient/[Git Local Repositories for the Impatient].

=== Create the Branch

Create new branch feat_#42 locally

[source,shell]
----
git checkout -b feat_#42
----

Create the remote branch with the same name and initiate tracking, assuming your remote uses the standard default name origin.

[source,shell]
----
git push -u origin feat_#42
----

=== Work on the Branch

Add your changes and commit them regularly.

[source,shell]
----
git commit -a -m “commit message describing activities for feat_#42“
----

Upon running the unit tests locally, push the changes to repository.

[source,shell]
----
git push
----

_Now you can test the branch from the central repository and deploy it to your continuous integration pipeline environment._

=== Merge the Branch

Switch to master and synchronize with your remote repository, the _-p_ parameter means __--prune__.

[source,shell]
----
git checkout master
git fetch --all -p
git pull
----

Merge to master.
The option --no-ff will always keep branch information.

[source,shell]
----
git merge --no-ff feat_#42
----

Or if you want a single commit to the complete branch.

[source,shell]
----
git merge —squash —no-ff feat_#42
----

Push the changes.

[source,shell]
----
git push
----

For advanced users, you can first rebase your branch and squash superfluous commits before merging the branch back to trunk.

=== Delete the Branch

Delete the remote branch (also _git branch -dr origin/feat_#42_).

[source,shell]
----
git push origin --delete feat_#42
----

Delete the local branch.

[source,shell]
----
git branch -d feat_#42
----

You are done.
Now you are ready to implement the next feature.

=== View local and remote Branches

If you want to view branches, use the following commands for the local branches.

[source,shell]
----
git branch
git branch --no-merged
----

If you want to view remote branches.

[source,shell]
----
git branch -r
git branch -r --no-merged
----

Checkout remote Branch.

The -p parameter means --prune

[source,shell]
----
git fetch --all -p
git checkout #feat_42
----

=== More Information

You can find a lot of information on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/git[Stack Overflow].
Beware when reading the answers on Stack Overflow that Git commands have changed over time.

The nifty-gritty details can be found in the official https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2[Git documentation].

[WARNING]
====
Beware that http://gitolite.com/[gitolite] does not support special characters such as # in branch names.
Use them only in the commit messages.
====

These same characters work in https://bitbucket.org/[bitbucket].
