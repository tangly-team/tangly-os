Lately people often ask me what is an agile company.
They have an understanding of agile software development techniques such as {ref-scrum}, Lean, Kanban, {ref-xp} but no clue how a company could be agile.

One way to approach this theme is to implement concepts of the above mentioned agile approaches. These are the pillars for iterative incremental improvements.

=== Scrum Pillars

Transparency::
 you trust all collaborators to provide their best when working on the product.
 They need full access to all relevant information: quality, progress, budget, people and financial data.
 They use the data to select the best alternatives to reach the company’s goals
Inspection::
 you cherish a failure culture because inspections will find weak points.
 You need a culture where people are never blamed.
 One consequence is that you eliminate management by objectives, and bonuses in your company
Adaptation::
 you are ready to learn better approaches and truly believe there is a better solution.
 Processes change regularly bottom-up, company’s budget can only be a rolling indicative budget, and planning has to be _continuously_ updated

You can also pursue desirable attitudes or values of agile persons

=== Scrum Values

Commitment::
 as an employee you want to win, you are engaged.
 Every manager truly believes you work best to achieve the goals.
 If not, this manager did a mistake by hiring or keeping you
Courage::
 you are ready to say “I am wrong” because being wrong opens the door for improvement
Focus::
 you daily optimise the customers’ value and thrive for excellence.
 As a developer you do not work on projects, you work on excellent products.
 You provide value to your customers
Openness::
 you seek better ideas and ways of doing. Openness requires transparency and respect.
Respect::
 you truly respect customers, team members, collaborators, persons.
 In your team I will not hear any disrespectful comments about people

=== Modern Agile

The http://modernagile.org/[modern agile movement] defines guiding principles

Make people awesome::
 Dedicated collaborators want to give their best.
 Give them a purpose, a goal, empower them and let them climb the mountain.
 Thriving persons need purpose, excellence and autonomy.
 They are happier, healthier and more productive.
Deliver value continuously::
 Maintain sustainable pace and stability, all divisions of the organisation should focus on customer value.
 At the end of the day successful products are the only reason you get your paycheck.
Make safety a prerequisite::
 People do their best in their daily work, you believe in McGregor Y theory.
 Trust them and support them to become excellent.
 You shall develop self-awareness to increase safety.
Experiment and learn rapidly::
 you make mistakes, you learn and increase continuously the delivered value.
 You have a learning culture, you inspect and adapt.
 You can react to new opportunities faster than competitors.

=== Self Assessment

The above concepts are comprehensible.
How do you know if you are moving in the right direction.
A few concrete tests help you find out if you are an agile department or company.

* _Be agile_ instead of _do agile_.
 Practice the above attitudes and do not just follow a checklist
* Nobody micro-manages in your company
* _Feel accountable_ instead of _be accountable_.
 You want to improve and your company as a natural part of the daily work.
* _Compliment every collaborator_ you are working with at least once a week instead of _evaluating weaknesses and criticising people_.
 o you lead by example?
* No management by objectives - MBO - or bonuses are established in your company
* Every collaborator has access to all company data, every collaborator can request process and tool changes.
 We favour _Individuals and interactions over  tools and processes_
* You want to be excellent in your work.
 You have a purpose and autonomy in your daily work
* Team members take the decision to hire or to fire collaborators, not the department responsible or the human resources group.
 Think about collaborators selecting their leaders, about managers being servants, about information available to all collaborators
* Can you say the most important one word _Sorry_, the most important two words _Thank you_, the most important three words _I was wrong_ and the most
important four words _Can I help you?_ at least three times a week?

I truly believe that we all want a fulfilling job which improves our world.
I cannot understand other reasons to spend 40 hours and more per week for something less valuable.
Take the above principles and apply them to your daily work.
There are universal values to establish a working atmosphere you are proud of.

_I agree with all of you to desire a fulfilling job is only true if you earn enough money to pay your monthly bills._
