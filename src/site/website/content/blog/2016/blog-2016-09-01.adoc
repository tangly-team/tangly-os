What are the main hurdles to introducing agile approaches in Swiss companies?

* Introducing agile company-wide is a cultural change process.
Such a change takes time and sometimes hurts.
* Without the commitment of senior management, the initiative will fail.
* Doubt that lean or agile works, doubt you can find agile experts, doubt that your projects can be realised with agile approaches.
* In the end, what matters are collaborator purpose, customer satisfaction, business value.

has published a _SwissQ Agile Trends & Benchmark Switzerland 2012_.

Below some findings of the study.

== Major Hurdles When Introducing Agile Approaches

We wrote on blogs that introducing Scrum in the development department or in the whole company is a
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_management[change process].
The coaches should be trained in change management and have experiences with resistance to changes.

The above points in italics are all related to changing processes.
You can handle two thirds of the hurdles with adequate change management training and a clear change product definition.
Do not try to introduce Scrum at company level without such an approach.

== The main Reasons Why Agile Projects are Cancelled

* 52%: Missing experience with agile approaches
* 45%: Company culture clashes with agile principles

** {ref-scrum} 84.5%,
** {ref-kanban} 16.9%,

** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrumban[Scrumban] 8.5%,
** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature-driven_development[Feature Driven Development] FDD 0%
* 38%: Missing support from senior management
* 37%: Missing or insufficient training and coaching

We wrote in previous link:../../2016/scrum-master-is-a-full-time-role[Scrum master is a full time job] that the Scrum Master is of tremendous importance.
You need a skilled and enthusiastic Scrum Master; avoid Scrum Administrator.
The new version of the Scrum guide clearly stated who is responsible for the introduction of the Scrum approach in the company?
Often people state that the management should spread Scrum in the company.
Ken and Jeff have a clear idea who is in charge of this.

[quote]
____
The Scrum Master serves the organization in several ways, including:

* *Leading* and *coaching* the organization in its Scrum adoption;
* *Planning* Scrum implementations within the organization;
* Helping employees and stakeholders understand and enact Scrum and empirical product development;
* Causing change that increases the productivity of the Scrum Team; and,
* *Working* with other Scrum Masters to increase the effectiveness of how you apply Scrum in the organization.
____

So the Scrum Master is a main driver for the introduction of Scrum in all departments and levels in the company.
He needs senior management support, but the Scrum Master's daily job is to spread Scrum in the company.
