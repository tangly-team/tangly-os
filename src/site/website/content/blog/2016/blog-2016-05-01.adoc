I am very happy we discuss in depth the role, responsibilities and activities of a good Scrum Master.
I fully agree with Scrum advocates that Scrum Master is a dedicated full-time job.

I am also convinced a Scrum Master can support multiple experienced Scrum teams.
The Large Scale Scrum framework {ref-less} states a full-time Scrum Master supports 1 to 3 teams.

I worked with quite a few Scrum Masters, Product Owners, and Scrum teams.
My experience shows it is more productive and effective when the Scrum Master works full-time as (see
http://www.barryovereem.com/the-8-stances-of-a-scrum-master/[white paper of Barry Overeem])

. a servant leader
. a coach
. a facilitator
. a teacher
. a mentor
. an impediment remover
. a change agent
. a manager (please restrain yourself)

He should not implement stories.
A Scrum Master is under huge stress being a development team member and having to balance their Scrum Master responsibilities against the commitment of the sprint goals.

So you shall have full-time Scrum Masters.
More important is that you have real Scrum Masters, and not only Scrum administrators who organize meetings and manage the Scrum board and burn-down charts.
{ref-scrum} has always been a hands-on approach to be successful in this you need to have a passion for getting your hands dirty.

Find out if you are a real professional Scrum master.
Do you perform each sprint the top things a Scrum Master usually forgets to focus on?

. Do Gemba. Redefine career paths, incentives, organization to be more Scrum focused,
. Identify with the product owner and the development team missing product backlog items,
. State team issues not being discussed because they are too uncomfortable,
. Find out an appropriate balance between end-to-end system tests and unit tests,
. Play back the team's progress against the proposed release plan,
. Integrate all tests into continuous integration, delivery and deployment,
. Coach team members to understand the benefits of refactoring, removing waste and focus on quality,
. Teach Kaizen. Coach team to peer review and continuously improve towards perfection,
. Teach pair programming on a daily basis,
. Expand with the team and the organization the definition of done. Beware it can trigger an organizational change.

I hope the discussion what a successful Scrum master does stay active.
Avoid agile coaches not being Scrum masters, they are not doing https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemba[Gemba] and loose contact with the knowledge workers.

It is a huge gain for the Agile community that people and organizations understand that a Scrum master is a professional coach, teacher, mentor, and change catalyst.
