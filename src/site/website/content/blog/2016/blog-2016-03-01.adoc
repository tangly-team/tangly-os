I loved Linux as a young developer.
I compiled new kernels during evening sessions.
I worked hard to install and configure drivers to support the hardware I had bought.

I explored forums and talked with technical support specialists to activate hardware or support the resolution of my display.
I struggled days to have the correct drivers for the graphic card and communication components of my notebook.

I grew older and decided to enjoy my evenings and weekends with my family and friends.
Surely I would prefer to have no virus, trojan and other evils in my workstation.

So I went to macOS and Apple notebooks without regrets.

== Gains

The major gains upon migrating to OS X are:

* No virus scanners are necessary, the speed-up during complex programming and development activities is tremendous.
* No trouble when updating the operating system, updates are automatic, and often no new start is required.
* Unix Command Line and Tools are available in the console.
{ref-homebrew} or https://www.macports.org/[MacPorts] projects provide all known and less-known utilities and programs available under Linux
footnote:[I currently use {ref-homebrew}. The available packages and the handling are excellent.].
* A long-lived notebook is still working and looking nice after five years of daily usage.
The performance is more than adequate for software development with Java 8/9/10/11 stack and {cpp}.

The last notebooks I had all lasted between six and nine years.
These computers were used daily the first five years.

== Daily Development

The tools I really enjoy and use on a daily basis for software development as I mainly developed in Java - are:

* https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/[IntelliJ IDEA] IDE,
* Atlassian Cloud applications - BitBucket, HipChat, CI pipeline -,
* {ref-homebrew} as package manager for utilities,
* Docker as container manager,
* VirtualBox when I need a full-fledged virtual machine,
footnote:[The need of virtual machines for daily work is fading away.].

== Daily Work

The tools I use to perform administrative work are:

* https://www.libreoffice.org/[LibreOffice],
* Google Business for team work in the cloud using collaborative tools,
* Apple Mail Client with https://gpgtools.org/[GPG] plugin for PGP and S/MIME secure email,
* A local Swiss application https://www.banana.ch[Banana] for accounting and VAT reports for the federal government.
I bought it as soon as the company stopped requesting higher prices for OS X than for the other platforms.

LibreOffice completely replaced Microsoft Office suite.
I stopped using OpenOffice after the strange behavior of Oracle with the application.

I never really regretted leaving Linux or https://ubuntu.com/[Ubuntu] behind me.
