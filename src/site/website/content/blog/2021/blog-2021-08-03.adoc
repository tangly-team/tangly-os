You work as a Scrum master.

Congratulations, working as a professional https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#scrum-master[Scrum master] is a fulfilling and exciting job.

You should attend professional training.

Not only attend the two-day training to receive a shiny diploma.

Being a Scrum master and coach is a profession, not a fancy title!

Please reflect on your goals and ethics.

=== Scrum Master Role

Here the official definition of the product owner role taken from the {ref-scrumguide}.

The *Scrum Master* is accountable for establishing *Scrum* as defined in the Scrum Guide.
They do this by helping everyone understand Scrum theory and practice, both within the Scrum Team and the organization.

The https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#scrum-master[Scrum Master] is accountable for the Scrum Team’s effectiveness.
They do this by enabling the Scrum Team to improve its practices, within the Scrum framework.

Scrum Masters are true leaders who serve the Scrum Team and the larger organization.

The Scrum Master serves the Scrum Team in several ways, including:

* Coaching the team members in *self-management* and *cross-functionality*;
* Helping the Scrum Team focus on creating high-value *Increments* that meet the *Definition of Done*;
* Causing the removal of impediments to the Scrum Team’s progress; and,
* Ensuring that all Scrum events take place and are *positive, productive, and kept within the time box*.

The Scrum Master serves the Product Owner in several ways, including:

* Helping find techniques for effective Product Goal definition and Product Backlog management;
* Helping the Scrum Team understand the need for clear and concise Product Backlog items;
* Helping establish empirical product planning for a complex environment; and,
* Facilitating stakeholder collaboration as requested or needed.

The Scrum Master serves the organization in several ways, including:

* Leading, training, and coaching the organization in its Scrum adoption;
* Planning and advising Scrum implementations within the organization;
* Helping employees and stakeholders understand and enact an empirical approach for complex work; and,
* Removing barriers between stakeholders and Scrum Teams.

=== Certifications

The two big Scrum organizations {ref-scrum-alliance} and {ref-scrum-org} provide a certification path for Scrum masters.
The certification path has three levels:

Certified Scrum Master::
Introduction course for those who are closest to the _organization_ of the project. +
_It is usually a two days training.
The https://www.scrum.org[Scrum.org] allows taking the certification examination without attending a course._
Certified Advanced Scrum Master::
Advanced course for Scrum Masters who already have one year of experience on a Scrum team. +
_It is at least two days training.
You should read the recommended books to have a greater probability to pass the examination on the first try._
Certified Scrum Professional Scrum Master::
Pinnacle course for experts wishing to master the Scrum Master track. +
_The third level requires more training, experience, and reading books.
You often must participate to workshops before being allowed to graduate.
Each certification organization has her own rules and conditions._

Beware if you select the https://www.scrumalliance.org/[Scrum Alliance], you must renew your certification every two years.
The conditions are similar to the renewal of a PMI certification.
You must provide proof of training and pay a fee.
The https://www.scrum.org[Scrum.org] certifications never expire.

=== Project Leadership Trainings

image::2021-08-03-pmi-talent-triangle.png[width=420,height=360,role=left]

An interesting development is the addition of tailored project management trainings emphasizing agile approaches.
The biggest organization https://www.pmi.org[PMI] has a whole set of agile certifications based on
https://www.pmi.org/certifications/agile-certifications[Disciplined AgileDesign] _DAD_.

I expect the emphasis on agile approaches to markantly increase in the next years.

=== University Formal Trainings

Technical universities in Switzerland provide formal training in project leadership, project management and related fields.
The formation provides a certificate of advanced study CAS in the field.
Current available certificates of advanced study offering are for example:

* FHNW https://www.fhnw.ch/de/weiterbildung/wirtschaft/cas-agile-leadership[CAS Agile Leadership]
