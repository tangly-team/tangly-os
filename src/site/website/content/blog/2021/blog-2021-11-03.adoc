{ref-gradle} is my preferred build tool for all Java applications I am developing.

Google chose Gradle as the official build tool for Android.
Not only because build scripts are code, but because Gradle is modeled in a way that is extensible in the most fundamental ways.
Gradle's model also allows it to be used for native development with C/C++ and can be expanded to cover any ecosystem.
For example, Gradle is designed with embedding in mind using its Tooling API.

What are my preferred goodies with the major version 7?

=== Java Module Native Support

Java modules were introduced with Java 9 in September 2017.
Adoption was slow.
Developers needed time to understand the tremendeous advantages of language and compiler support of modules.
Tooling was also a problem.
It was cumbersome and error prone to create Java modules either using the command line and experimental plugins.

{ref-gradle} version 7 finally supports Java modules natively.
Just use the _java-library_ plugin.

The plugin will detect the presence of a _module-info.java_ module declaration file and transparently switch to module compilation.

=== Dependencies Semantic Declaration

The Gradle team has decided to introduce semantic support for the declaration of dependencies.

All dependencies of a multi-module Java application are declared in a central file.

Support is provided to group a set of related dependencies and use the alias in the various Gradle modules.

=== IntelliJ Support

Jetbrains has improved support of Gradle in their new releases of IntelliJ.
The 2021 versions offer native support of Gradle.
Native support means IntelliJ finally uses Gradle for compilation and unit testing inside the IDE.
You just need to take care of one build configuration and no more need to delve in the mysteries of IntelliJ build process.

The only glitch is that IntelliJ has its own concept of modules no synchronzied with the Gradle modules.
You have to be careful to allign both structures to avoid surprises.

=== Wishes

I would greatly appreciate if the the JaCoCo Gradle plugin is improved and allign with the features of the Maven plugin.
The process to aggregate the coverage reports on a multi-module project is cumbersome and brittle.
