I truly love the new release rhythm of the Java ecosystem.
Being able to use new features every six months is awesome.
The migration overhead is held to a minimum thanks to the incredible backward compatibility.

The new features greatly simplify existing code and tremendously increase legibility.

Features like _records_, _sealed types_, or _switch expressions_ are wonderful.
The promise of advanced pattern matching constructs is sweet.

Polishing of functional programming approach improved my source code quite stupendously.

=== New Features

Java 16 fully support https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_data_type[Algebraic Data Types] with the https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/395[record] and
https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/397[sealed types] features.

The first step with modern pattern matching constructs was provided with https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/394[Pattern Matching for Instanceof].

The other new features are more of internal nature.

Notice that https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/386[Alpine Unix] is now officially supported.
This port is great new to shrink the size of docker images containing a Java runtime.

=== Troubles With Some Packages

MicroStream:: https://microstream.one/[MicroStream] persistence library crashes if you are using records.
ArchUnit:: https://www.archunit.org/[ArchUnit] crashes if you are using records.
jacoco:: https://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/index.html[Jacoco] has trouble to handle records.

Records were announced more than a year ago.
Wake-up call to maintainers of Java libraries.

Please do not be laggards.
Did you realize that since Java 8 a new version is release every six months?

=== Next Changes I am Dreaming Of

Concise Method Body:: Syntactic sugar to write compact delegation classes.
It provides the same mechanisms for method overwriting as for lambda declarations.

Switch Type Selection:: We can already chain _if else if_ statements with *instanceof* operator and variable declarations.
I want to do the same in a _switch_ statement.

More Packages Support Modules:: Java modules were introduced with Java 8.
I really, really, really want to use module in Java 16.
Therefore, I need a module version for all mainstream Java libraries.
