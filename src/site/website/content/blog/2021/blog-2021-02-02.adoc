=== File System NIO

Java NIO (New IO) is an alternative IO API for Java, meaning alternative to the standard Java IO and Java Networking API's.
Java NIO offers a different IO programming model than the traditional IO APIs.

[NOTE]
====
Sometimes NIO is claimed to mean Non-blocking IO.
However, this is not what NIO meant originally.
Also, parts of the NIO APIs are actually blocking - e.g. the file APIs - so the label "Non-blocking" would be slightly misleading.

One major feature of interest is the support of file systems.
An in-memory file system is ideal to test file related operations in unit and integration tests

=== Unit Tests

The https://github.com/google/jimfs[Jimfs] library implements an in-memory file system.
The approach is ideal to write unit tests working with files.
These unit tests can also be deployed in a continuous integration pipeline where you do not have a documented and reliable acess to a file system.

When you look at the implementation of Path.of or Paths.get, you will see this:

[source,java]
----
public static Path of(String first, String... more) {
    return FileSystems.getDefault().getPath(first, more);
}
----

So, while this method and simiar ones are very convenient, using them will imply you want to access your default FileSystem.
The one your JVM is running on, not your in-memory FileSystem.

Hence, when wanting to make sure your code works against in-memory file systems, you must make sure to never call these helpers methods.
Instead, you should always use the FileSystem or a Path as an anchor, like you are doing in the examples above.

Depending on your project and your libraries, this is quite a challenge to pull off
footnote:[I regularly open issues in various open source libraries to request an API extension to support Path.
Often the maintainer of the library is not aware you need Path to unit test with in-memory file systems.].

=== Paths

Alternative file system operations require all methods should use path objects instead of file objects.
File objects contain the name of the accessed file but loose all references to the underlying file system.
All operations using file objects implicitly use the default file system.

Path objects encapsulate the file and the file system.
Operations are aware of the underlying file system and behave as expected.

Consider the Java file class as a legacy abstraction.
Avoid using it and move over to the Java path abstraction.

=== Learnt Lessons

Legacy libraries heavily use File objects in their algorithms and their public interface.
Such libraries do *not* work with in-memory file systems.

The simplest approach is to always provide an API returning streams in addition of file systems methods.
It is always possible to map a stream to a file system specific streams for read and write operations.

The more complex approach is to replace all _File_ objects with _Path_ objects.
Ideally the Java community should declare the _File_ class as a deprecated one.
Another solution would be to extend File with an internal path instance.
This approach could break backward compatibility.
