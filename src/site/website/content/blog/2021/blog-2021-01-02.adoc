Identifiers are identifiers.
Identifiers cannot be changed at any time.
Updating identifiers means introducing mapping relations between the old and the new values.

____
In computer science, identifiers (IDs) are lexical tokens that name entities.
Identifiers are used extensively in virtually all information processing systems.
Identifying entities makes it possible to refer to them, which is essential for any kind of symbolic processing.

=== External Well-Defined Identifiers

The best identifiers are externally well-defined identifiers.
A unique and well-defined authority is responsible to define and publish them.
Examples are

* Currency names as defined in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217[ISO standard 4217],
* Country abbreviations as define in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes[ISO standard 3166],
* Social security numbers are well documented in the country they are used,
* Car numbers are well-known and documented.

As much as possible try to use global identifiers.
Examples are

* IBAN account numbers are defined worldwide through https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Bank_Account_Number[ISO 13616],
* Car numbers and country acronyms are defined worldwide,
* Passport numbers are defined worldwide.
Each country has its own structure and conventions,
* Social security numbers are a counter-example.
There are currently only defined locally.

=== External Managed Identifiers

You shall document the source of truth for all externally defined and managed identifiers.

=== Internal Managed Identifiers

One possible approach is to define a naming convention such as

Year - Acronym - Counter

An example of such an identifier would be

    2021-CNT-0001 (Contract number 1 in year 2021)
    2020-EVT-0101 (Event number 101 in year 2020)

Variations are

* A full date as prefix, our system uses this convention to name invoices,
* A more readable acronym, our system uses the word invoice to name invoices.

=== Lessons Learnt

Always try to find an external well-defined identifier for your entities.

Avoid by all means to use an internal privately defined identifier as a public one.
You will bear the burden to document, manage and evolve the scheme as soon as you do this.
