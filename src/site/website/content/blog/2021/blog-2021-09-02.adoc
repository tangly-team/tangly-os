=== Lecture Content

The lecture description is

* Teaches the basics of systematic agile design of an adequate software architecture for a selected application.
* Methods of agile quality assurance and software craftsmanship are explored using predefined or self-selected projects of students.

The lecture themes are:

. Why Agile Architecture and Design?
. Evolution of Software Architecture over the last Decades
. What is Agile Architecture?
. Agile Approaches with Scrum, XP, LeSS
. Refactoring
. Errors, Vulnerabilities, Smells in Source Code
. Architecture of Components and Subsystems
. Verify Functional Features
. Validate Quality Attributes of Software Architecture
. Architecture Documentation
. Architecture Trends I
. Architecture Trends II
. Domain Driven Design Workshop
. Team and Technical Excellence for Architects

=== Lessons Learnt

Principiles need to be taught at the beginning.
The students know concepts such as KISS, SOLID, NIH.
They seldom can apply them in their own code or semester projects.

Design concepts must be refined.
The students understand concepts such as patterns, micro-architecture, layered architecture.
They seldom formulate the technical and financial tradeoffs associated with a specific concept application.

Almost no student has experience with open source libraries.
They use them on a daily basis and never looked at the source code, provided an improvement, or read the documentation.
