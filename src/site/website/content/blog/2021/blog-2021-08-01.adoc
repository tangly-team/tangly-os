*Everybody is talking about being agile*.

Companies institutionalize agile change programs and send all their collaborators in training to learn the agile way.

What does that mean?

How should I as a manager work the agile way?

Does this agile way exist, or is it simply a fad created by the consulting industry?

This article provides some pointers and hypotheses what agile leadership could be.

Feel free to experiment and refine your successful approach to be agile as an organization.
You must experiment, learn and train to become a successful agile leader cite:[great-scrum-master,scrum-pocket-guide-3rd].
It is a job, not a hobby.

____
Organizational agility cannot exceed the level of personal leadership agility of those with the most influence in an organization.

Because agile leadership involves ongoing personal development, it is not something that can be mastered in a single training course.

=== Agile Leaders engage, and serve the team at the place of work

Serving the team is all the rage these days.
You hear or read about Servant Leadership at every turn.
But serving the team is too often interpreted as waiting for the team to ask for help.

Rather than wait for the team, go to the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemba[Gemba] — the actual place of work.

* Get out of your office and engage with the team.
* Help them as they deliver.
* See their problems first hand.
* You will know exactly what they are working on.
* It will become obvious how you can help.

You start helping and playing the part only you as a leader can fill.
This is a true service to the team by being a contributing member of the team.

=== Growing your team is critical

By engaging shoulder to shoulder with your teams, you can help them grow.
As a leader, you can teach them how to navigate complexity.

You must engender an ability in your team members to think using the scientific method.
It is impossible to teach every possible scenario your teams will encounter.
Teach them how to probe, sense, and respond.
This will give them critical abilities to solve complex problems on their own.

It builds self-organizing skills in your teams.
{ref-scrum} framework provides hints what the minimal expected behaviors you should expect.
There are several references to self-management in the {ref-scrumguide} as in the current version of 2020.

[cite,{ref-scrumguide}]
____
Adaptation becomes more difficult when the people involved are not empowered or self-managing.

_Scrum Teams_ are also self-managing, meaning they internally decide who does what, when, and how.

They are structured and empowered by the organization to manage their own work.

The Scrum Master serves the Scrum Team in several ways, including coaching the team members in self-management and cross-functionality.

_Sprint Planning: How will the chosen work get done?_ How this is done is at the sole discretion of the Developers.
No one else tells them how to turn Product Backlog items into Increments of value.

The Developers can select whatever structure and techniques they want, as long as their Daily Scrum focuses on progress toward the Sprint Goal and produces an actionable plan for the next day of work.
This creates focus and improves self-management.

The Sprint Backlog is a plan by and for the Developers.
____

You can use various indicators to detect the self-management requirement at the Scrum team level is no more than lip service:

* You assign specific tasks directly to Developers, thus bypassing the Product Owner.
* Alternatively, you remove a Developer from the Scrum team (temporarily) to work on such a task.
* Developers are assigned to support other organization members while ignoring their commitment to achieving the Sprint Goal.
Examples are supporting sales in a pitch, or being an expert in management meetings.
* Scrum is rolled back in a moment of crisis to a traditional form of command & control, exercised, for example, by dispatching jobs directly to individual Developers.

Ignoring self-management does not only violate Scrum’s first principles.
It also indicates that a manager cannot let go of command and control practices.
They continue to micromanage subordinates, although a Scrum team could accomplish the task themselves.
This behavior demonstrates a level of ignorance that may require support from a higher management level to address.

=== Leading by Example to nurture resilient change

* Co-select with the teams proficient and experienced agile coaches and Scrum masters
* Promote purpose, autonomy, mastery, accountability, strong social connection, small wins
* Put emphasis on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development[Information Radiators]

Think about

* Collocation,
* Radical transparency,
* Job rotations,
* Team liaisons,
* Community of practices,
* Servant leader.

[quote,Peter Drucker]
