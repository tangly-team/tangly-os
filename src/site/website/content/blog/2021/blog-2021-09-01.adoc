The static website build tool {ref-hugo} is awesome.
With the extensive built-in feature set of Hugo and the feature-rich text formatting options that https://asciidoc.org/[Asciidoc] offers, it creates a blogging experience composed of easy content management and fun writing experience.

In most static site generators including Hugo, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown[Markdown] is the one and only first-class citizen when it comes to creating posts.

However, in recent Hugo versions, external helpers are an official feature.
It calls appropriate external programs to certain type of files.
Fortunately, {ref-asciidoc} based files are automatically compiled with https://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor], so we do not need to do anything.
Just have it installed and you are ready to go.

The Hugo theme {ref-docsy} is ideal to create a good-looking software documentation site.
This theme is currently the best match I found to combine product documentation with blogging.

I love to write my documentation and blogs using {ref-asciidoc} notation
footnote:[If you are new to asciidoc, you can experiment https://asciidoclive.com/[online].].
The official site is {ref-asciidoc}.
A major tool chain can be found under https://docs.asciidoctor.org/home/[AsciiDoctor].].

[NOTE]
====
Hugo supports Asciidoctor through external helpers.
External helpers are relatively new and more like an experimental feature.
There is a proposal on improving it by adding user configurations so at least there is hope for this particular feature to expand.
====

The features of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AsciiDoc[AsciiDoc] set is equivalent to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DocBook[DocBook].
The readers with grey hair probably remember https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Generalized_Markup_Language[SGML], the ancestor of DocBook.
The librarians could remember https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX[LaTeX] created by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Lamport[Leslie Lamport].
He created it to describe https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_logic[temporal logic] aspects of cluster communication for the
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation[Digital Equipment Corporation] _DEC_ solution.
These highly qualified experts and their solutions paved the way to legible documentation and professional typography.

=== Source Code Highlight

Asciidoctor supports rouge source code highlighting per default
footnote:[Beware the Hugo documentation stating you have to import an extension for syntax highlighting is plain wrong if you are using
https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoctor/latest/syntax-highlighting/rouge/[rouge].].
You do need to add any extension to Hugo.
Just select the style you prefer such as:

[source,yaml]
----
rouge-style = "github"
----

=== Search Function for the Website

The theme has multiple search solutions to index your static website.
I chose the https://lunrjs.com/[Lunr] approach for our site.
The solution has no strings attached and does not require an external search server.

The website and the search functionality are self-contained as a static website should be.

=== Comment Function for Blog Article

The comment feature is somewhat at odds with the concept of static website.
The theme has multiple comment solutions to allow readers to publish a question or a test to our site.
I decided to provide comments only to the blog part of the website.
I chose the https://utteranc.es/[Utterances] approach for our site.
The solution has no strings attached and uses the well-known platform GitHub.
No tracking, no ads and no locking are great.

The comment author must first log in GitHub before adding her comment therefore spamming or flaming are minimized.

You have to create a partial in docsy to use Utterances.

[source,html]
----
<div class="page-blank">
    <div id="utterancers_thread"></div>
    <script src="https://utteranc.es/client.js"
            repo= {{ .Site.Params.comments_utterances_repo }}
            issue-term= {{ .Site.Params.comments_utterances_issue_term }}
            theme= {{ .Site.Params.comments_utterances_theme }}
            crossorigin="anonymous"
            async>
    </script>

=== Tag Function for Blog Article

Docsy has finally merged the change request for taxonomies during the first semester of 2021.
Tags for articles are now natively supported without tinkering with the code of the plugin.

Our http://blog.tangly.net/blog/[blog] displays the tags on the right side of the window.
Give it a try.

=== Diagrams in articles

Diagrams in blog articles are currently a more complex issue.
Hugo seems to be quite restrictive which extensions can be loaded when generating a static site.
No reasonable reasons exit for the above-mentioned restrictions.
Ongoing pull requests try to improve the situation.

I had success with:

https://plantuml.com/[plantUML] diagrams::
See for example following blogs link:../../2021/gitlab-for-bachelor-students[GitLab for Students]
https://mermaid-js.github.io/[mermaid] diagrams::
See for example following blogs link:../../2021/agile-trends-switzerland-2021[Agile Trend 2021] or
link:../../2021/agile-trends-switzerland-2020[Agile Trend 2020].

The generated HTML code does not respect all AsciiDoc parameters.
Text flow configurations are not enforced.

=== Layout and Appearance

The docsy theme is regularly improving.
The provided features are good and very stable.

The Hugo integration of {ref-asciidoc} is subpar.
The CSS styling files of {ref-asciidoc} are not integrated with Hugo and themes.
Often the appearance of the generated HTML could be improved.
I am currently exploring venues to improve the integration of nice looking asciidoc styling sheets with the docsy universe.

=== Future Features

I have integrated an extension to provide access to static files through a Hugo/Docsy site.
For example the presentation of a speech is made available directly in the static website.

This feature is currently experimental and queued as a pull request in the Docsy GitHub repository
footnote:[This feature removed my dependency to Google drive to host downloadable artifacts.].
