Slowly, slowly major actors in the software architecture landscape acknowledge agile development is state of the industry approach to build software products.

They are still struggling to integrate their older views in a faster, iterative, incremental development approach.
The duration of a regular Scrum sprint is usually two weeks.

More important they have discovered we build products because no customers buy projects.
They buy solutions and products.

I am relieved I need less fighting to convince enterprise architects that agile is the way.
The big names https://www.pmi.org/[_Project Management Institute_], https://www.opengroup.org/[_Open Group_], and https://www.isaqb.org/[_iSAQB_]
have at last an agile architecture offering.

If pushed they acknowledge agile development is mainstream and used in the overwhelming majority of complex product development.

We have learnt it is difficult to concede and congratulate the winning party.

Look at the president of the United States of America https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump[Donald Trump] to have a well documented case of a loser trying all lies and tricks to avoid the reality.
No long ago the tobacco industry did the same as professional liars.
And we still have the climate change deniers.

We show mercy to all the software architecture and designer traditionalists who needed almost twenty years to acknowledge the supremacy of agile approaches.

Laggards, please bow and embrace modern software development approaches.

=== PMI and Disciplined Agile Delivery

PMI realized a few years ago their standard approach to project management was loosing ground in the software industry.

The first step was the _PMI Agile Certified Practitioner_ certification to test what agile is.
They never really integrated it with their other certifications.

The coup was their acquisition of _Disciplined Agile Delivery_ in the second half of 2019.
The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disciplined_agile_delivery[DAD] approach is around since 2015 and had some success.

The framework has a complexity sympathetic to PMI.
The roots of a lot of DaD concepts can be found in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_Unified_Process[Rational Unified Process] _RUP_.
It is an https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_and_incremental_development[Iterative and Incremental Development] methodology.
RUP is certainly not agile.

The founder of DAD https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Ambler[Scott W. Ambler] has a long history with the Unified Modeling Language and CMM.

Anyway it is a huge step for PMI to move away from traditional heavy project development methods and embrace somehow agile product development.

=== Open Group and Open Agile Architecture Initiative

The open group has stewardship for the TOGAF enterprise architecture standard and training.

The open group has started to discuss the future of software architecture and agile approaches with a white paper second half of 2019.
They published a first potential approach to agile software architecture end of 2020.

The approach is quite rough.
It is more a collection of ideas available in various approaches and ideas picked from the Internet.
The fact they recognized the necessity to have an agile solution is encouraging.

The open agile architecture shows they are at the very beginning of their journey.

They will have to compromise and find a way to integrate TOGAF ideas with agile concepts.
Personally I am not sure the result will be pretty.

The concepts and techniques defined in TOGAF are reasonable.
The official process how to implement them is flawed.
You cannot work with short iterations and incrementally improve your solution upon discovering new facts in a timely and efficient manner.

=== iSAQB Agile Software Architecture

The German software architecture bastion is finally fallen. https://www.isaqb.org/[iSAQB] provides an
https://www.isaqb.org/certifications/cpsa-certifications/cpsa-advanced-level/agila-agile-software-architecture/[advanced level module]
for agile software architecture.
Their proposal of the module is described below.

* The participants learn how to design, develop and further develop software systems and architectures in accordance with agile principles.
* On one hand, the module covers the application of agile principles and concepts to architecture work.
On the other hand expedient anchoring of architecture practices in an agile approach.
* The development of architectures in projects with self-sufficient teams or shared responsibilities demands new skills and capabilities on the part of developers and architects.
* We cover technical as well as methodical and also communicative aspects, which are addressed here all theoretically and in practical exercises.

The above statements are quite shallow.
I hope they will add more material in the future.

=== Agile Requirements Engineering

Interestingly the requirements community is further on the path to agility.
The most relevant organization is Europe is the https://www.ireb.org/[International Requirements Engineering Board] _IREB_.
The organization offers two certifications with emphasis on agile approaches:

* RE@Agile Primer - Bridging the gap between RE and Agile
* Advanced Level RE@Agile - is part of the advanced CPRE AL

=== Agile Testing Engineering

Interestingly the quality insurance and testing community is further on the path to agility.
The most relevant organization is Europe is the https://www.https://www.istqb.org/[International Software Testing Qualifications Borad] _ISTQB_.
The organization offers a whole set of certifications with emphasis on agile approaches:

* Foundation Level Agile Tester
* Advanced Level Agile Test Leadership at Scale
* Advanced Level Agile Technical Tester

A nice bonus is that _IREB_ and _ISTQB_ work together to align their terminology and approaches.
