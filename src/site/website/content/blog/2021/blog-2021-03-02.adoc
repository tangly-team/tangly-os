=== Cool Approach

https://microstream.one/[MicroStream] approach empowers Java developers.
You can persist your whole data model with less than a hundred lines of code.
The library is efficient and works reliably.

Modern architectures based on bounded domains and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design[Domain Driven Design] are supported.

The company behind the product has promised to open source their product beginning of 2021.

I use to library to prototype bounded domain implementations requiring persistent data.
The implementation speed and ease are awesome.
I hope the current flaws of the product will be removed and allow productive use.

=== Constraints

Saving a Java Object::
The library made some strange design decisions.
If you want to persist an instance having fields using collections, you must use the _eager_ mode.
Beware that you must explicitly commit the transaction if using the _eager_ mode.
Debugging problems::
The source code is currently obfuscated.
Debugging is difficult and cumbersome because variable names are synthetic and all comments are missing.
Saving a collection::
If you have access to the collection, just call store on the collection.
If the collection is hidden inside an object, you are forced to use _eager_ store.

=== Design

Our provider persists instances for all our bounded domains in need of persistence.

=== Current Flaws

==== In Memory File System

In-memory file systems are a must for unit and integration testing.
A continuous integration pipeline does not always have access to a regular file system.
Disk based file systems are too slow for automatic testing.
footnote:[I have reported the bug how they used path instance. The developers were very supportive. The version 4.01 supports in-memory file systems such as JIMFS.]

We migrate with full success all our unit tests to use in-memory file systems in January 2021.
The execution speed rocks.
Thanks to the MicroStream developers.
See their _file systems_ example in their https://github.com/microstream-one/examples[GitHub example repository]

==== Java Records

Field cannot be manipulated anymore in record since Java JDK 1.5.1.
The _MicroStream_ 4.x releases crash when using record in JDK 15 and JDK 16. It only works with JDK 14.
You are forced to use an obsolete JDK no more supported.
For example IntelliJ IDEA stops to provide support for obsolete JDKs as soon as the new official JDK release is available.
It hinders you to use the associated preview features.

footnote:[I have reported the bug in the microstream forum and informed them that their clain they support these JDK is plain wrong. The project does not currently have a bug reporting system. We hope that the version promised for April 2021 will finally solved these show stoppers.]

I have to verify the library can cope with sealed declarations.

=== Next Steps

* Wait for the release scheduled for April 2021 and pray they will support record feature.
Records are an official feature in JDK 16 released in March 2021 and no more a preview feature.
* Codify a performant approach to save whole instances using eager store operations.
* Explore the migration features when the data schema is changing.
