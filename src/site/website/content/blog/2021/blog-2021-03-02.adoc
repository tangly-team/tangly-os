https://microstream.one/[MicroStream] approach empowers Java developers.
The library provides a cool and compact approach to persist complex data models.
You can persist your whole data model with less than a hundred lines of code.
The library is efficient and works reliably.

Modern architectures based on bounded domains and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design[Domain Driven Design] are supported.

The company behind the product has promised to open source their product beginning of 2021.

I use the library to prototype bounded domain implementations requiring persistent data.
The implementation speed and ease are awesome.
I hope the current flaws of the product will be removed and allow productive use.

== Constraints

Saving a Java Object::
The library made some strange design decisions.
If you want to persist an instance having fields based on collections, you must use the _eager_ mode.
Beware that you must explicitly commit the transaction if using the _eager_ mode.
The normal mode automatically commits the transaction.
I hope that the API improves, and the behavior is coherent for similar functions.
Debugging problems::
The source code is currently obfuscated.
Debugging is difficult and cumbersome because variable names are synthetic and all comments are missing.
The source code documentation is shallow and insufficient to understand the behavior of the library.
Saving a collection::
If you have access to the collection, just call store on the collection.
If the collection is hidden inside an object, you are forced to use an _eager_ store.
If you use standard object-oriented practices, you will have to use the less efficient approach of eager write operations.

== Design

Our provider persists instances for all our bounded domains in need of persistence.

== Current Flaws

=== In Memory File System

In-memory file systems are a must for unit and integration testing.
A continuous integration pipeline does not always have access to a regular file system.
Disk-based file systems are too slow for automatic testing
footnote:[I have reported the bug how they used path instances. The developers were very supportive. Version 4.01 supports in-memory file systems such as https://github.com/google/jimfs[Jimfs].].

We migrate with full success all our unit tests to use in-memory file systems in January 2021.
We use the https://github.com/google/jimfs[Jimfs] library.
When creating a Jimfs file system, you can specify whether it should imitate a UNIX- or Windows-style file system.
They differ in the naming conventions and attribute usage, so choose the one you prefer.
The Windows file system implements some Windowsâ€™ quirks, such as not permitting the creation of a file in the root directory.

The execution speed rocks.
Thanks to the MicroStream developers.
See their _file systems_ example in their https://github.com/microstream-one/examples[GitHub example repository]

=== Java Records

A field cannot be manipulated anymore in record since Java JDK 1.5.1.
The _MicroStream_ 4.x releases crash when using record in JDK 15 and JDK 16. It only works with JDK 14.
You are forced to use an obsolete JDK no more supported.
For example, the IntelliJ IDEA stops to provide support for obsolete JDKs as soon as the new official JDK release is available.
It hinders you to use the associated preview features
footnote:[I have reported the bug in the microstream forum and informed them that their claim they support these JDK is plain wrong. The project sadly does not currently have a
bug reporting system. I hope the version promised for April 2021 will finally solve these showstoppers.]
footnote:[Version 5.0 was released in July 2021 and finally provides support for records. You need to increase access to internal components with the option
_--add-exports=java.base/jdk.internal.misc=ALL-UNNAMED_ to have a working approach.].

I have to verify if the library can cope with sealed declarations.

== Next Steps

* Wait for the release scheduled for April 2021 and pray they will support the record feature.
Records are an official feature in JDK 16 released in March 2021 and no more a preview feature.
See our link:../../2021/modern-java-development/[Modern Java Development]
discussion how organizations cope with the Java release cycle or are just laggards.
* Codify a performant approach to save whole instances using eager store operations.
* Explore the migration features when the data schema is changing.
* Wait and see if the promised licensing under an open source copyright will be published.
