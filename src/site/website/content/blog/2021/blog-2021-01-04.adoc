=== Source Code Version Management with Git

https://git-scm.com/[Git] is the standard tool for distributed source code management system.
It is supported by all major development IDE and continuous integration environments.

First year students shall master the basic git commands to write their semester projects.

Second year students shall master the git commands used to work in teams.
Pull requests are a standard approach to review team colleague works and consolidate new functions into the application.

=== Modern Java Software Development

Java is the preferred programming language for the majority of teaching institutions around the world.
The programming language has evolved the last ten years.
Students should learn the current way of writing code in Java.
The actual Java approach is to use streams and renouce in most cases to use instructions such as _for_ or _while_ loops or conditional _if_ statements.
Delegation and lambda constructs often replace inheritance design.

The IntelliJ IDEA IDE is now the industrial standard for the Java and often Python world.
The IDEA environment promotes the use of modern Java constructs.
Currently, constructs such as records, sealed classes, closeable resources, switch instructions as expressions are new approaches to write legible Java code.
Concepts such as Optional, Streams, immutable objects, and unchecked expressions promote more functional programming styles.

https://gradle.org/[Gradle] is the preferred build tool for Java projects.

=== Technical Excellence

The DevOps and software craftsmanship movement strongly promote technical excellence and intrinsic quality in software development.

Students shall be fluent with

* Static code analysis
* Unit tests and integration tests
* Continuous integration pipeline

=== Documentation

You should only check text artifacts into a git repository.
Modern approaches with Markdown and AsciiDoc syntax promote this axiom.
PlantUMl is a text based diagramming approach.
All major syntax and in particular all UML diagram types are supported.
AsciiDoc has native support for diagrams in general and PlantUMl in particular.

=== Agile and Scrum

Agile and Scrum are the standard methods to develop software products in the industry.
All students shall excel in agile development approaches.
Scrum is the most used approach and should be taught to all computer science students.

Students shall understand the agile concepts and main constructs.
When working in a Scrum environment, they have used backlog, issues, stories, defintion of done.
They have planed their projects with a vision, a roadmap, epics, and sprints.

=== Gitlab as a Student's Tool

Gitlab is an integrated solution for software development in teams and DevOps approaches.

They learn the expertise and hands-on how to develop software application.
The students will use their learnings to develop software components when working after the completion of their studies.
All the above tools and approaches are now standard software development departments.

=== Gitlab as a Lecturer's Tool

All the source code and artifacts of a student class are available on Gitlab.
The development history over a project or a semester are visible in Git.
The lecturers can access the artifacts or use scripts to extract the data necessary to set the grades for the students.
The grading process can be standardized and the decison process is part of the gitlab data.
