=== Purpose

I am regularly asked by practitioners and technical universities which books I shall recommend learning more about agile developers, agile projects, and agile companies.

Below a selection of books I read and found fascinating.
The selection is certainly not exhaustive.
The criteria are

* I read the book and learnt something
* I have bought this book to have it as reference.
I mean a real reference opened at least monthly
* The book is available as ebook – I only read ebooks and save trees -

=== Software Engineering

* Scrum and XP From the Trenches: How We Do Scrum, Henrik Kniberg A short and very good introduction to Scrum and XP, worth looking again and again, Kniberg is also the guy behind the Spotify Way
* Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship, Robert C. Martin The reference book about clean code and XP practices.
You are a programmer, you know this book
* The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers, Robert C. Martin Are you a coder doing clean code (or are a looser)?
* Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code, Martin Fowler You cannot be agile and not do refactor, see also XP practices.
You shall refactor daily or you are lying to yourself
* Agile Project Management with Scrum, Ken Schwaber A seminal work from one of the founders of Scrum
* Agile Product Management With Scrum: Creating Products That Customers Love, Roman Pichler From the expert for product owner role and activities, Make the shift from project to product
* Agile Testing: A Practical Guide for Testers and Agile Teams, Lisa Crispin and Janet Gregory What does it mean to test and insure quality in an agile environment?

=== Agile Management Aspects

* Agile Management: Leadership in an agile environment, Angel Medinilla:
An overview about agile management at company level, you should also read the _Leader's Dilemma_ and see the {ref-bbrt} ideas.
* Leading Lean Software Development: Results Are Not the Point, Mary Poppendieck & Tom Poppendieck:
Lean often means to change your point of view to better understand the system.
* The Lean Mindset: Ask the Right Questions, Mary Poppendieck & Tom Poppendieck: What does lean mean?
* Fearless Change: Patterns for Introducing New Ideas, Mary Lynn Manns & Linda Rising:
When introducing changes, you have to understand change management.
You can later read the works of John P. Kotter.
* Agile Retrospective: Making Good Teams Great, Esther Derby & Diana Larsen & Ken Schwaber.
The major place where improvements are identified is during retrospectives, often the less well-managed meeting in a Scrum team.
* Practices for Scaling Lean and Agile Development, Craig Larman & Bas Vodde A set of practices and ideas how to do big agile projects, the guys behind {ref-less}
* Scaling Lean & Agile Development: Thinking and Organizational Tools for Large-Scale {ref-scrum}, Craig Larman and Bas Vodde A second set of practices and ideas how to do big agile projects, still the guys behind {ref-less}
* The Leader's Dilemma: How to Build an Empowered and Adaptive Organization Without Losing Control, Jeremy Hope & Peter Bunce &Franz Rösli & Franz Röösli The modern reference text for the BBRT initiative
