== Clean Your Desk

=== Digitalize Your Office

It is time to sell the last fax device in your office and plan to remove your big printer.
Burn your paper documentation and discard your folders.
Please store all the information digitally and have an effective search application in your company.
Use Wiki to publish company data and store knowledge for all collaborators.

Have a professional handset and a good camera for video conferences.

Put all your documents on your company drive and index all this information.
Finding relevant data by keyword searching is a huge gain of time.
Another advantage is no more backup of workstations and notebooks.
All mission-critical information is always on the company's drives.

=== Socialize with your Team

Organize a real team room.
Colocate all your team members, design on big whiteboards.
Please use analog Scrum boards.
You need big whiteboards, analog Scrum boards, meeting corners.

Restart your brown bag training program.
A Friday beer event is always a welcome event.

Celebrate success after each major release of your products.
Another gain is tension just disappears when people talk around snacks and drink together a glass of wine.

== Upgrade your Toolbox

As a Java developer, it is time to use state of the industry tools and improve your daily work

. Java 9 JDK, if you are still working with Java 7 or earlier, you are a laggard
.. Java 8 public support will end in the middle of next year.
.. Java 10 shall be available next year.
The early releases are already online.
Download them and try the new features.
The local variable declarations are a huge improvement.
.. You are a laggard and security danger if you are still using Java 6 or earlier.
. Gradle
.. Build, deliver, and deploy your solution with one keystroke.
. Continuous integration, delivery and deployment pipelines.
.. Never again manually configure a deployment by hand.
. Test environments with Docker
.. Never say again, _it is working on my machine_.
. Modern IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA
.. Splendid Gradle support.
.. Marvelous JUnit 5 support.
.. Alt-Enter anywhere brings up context-sensitive options.
Run a test, create a test, create a subclass, convert to closure, generate missing test methods, remove an explicit type, split into declaration and assignment, introduce local variable.
The suggestions are limitless.
.. Great Java 8 support, suggesting lambda notation where appropriate!
.. Even displaying anonymous inner class usage (collapsed) as if it was written using a lambda expression.
. Quality with PMD, FindBugs, SonarLint, or the built-in rules of IntelliJ
. Banish Flash from your workstation
