=== Start using Git

You shall put your source code under a version management system.
The actual industrial standard is https://git-scm.com/[git], a distributed version control system -
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_version_control[DVCS] -.

Install git on your development machine.
In case you are using the IntelliJ IDEA configure git in the IDE through the preference pane.

To put your product under git version management, go to the root of the product and perform the command

[source,shell]
----
git init
----

To add a specific file or all your source files to git

[source,shell]
----
git add [filename]
git add *
----

You shall perform these operations to add a product to a local Git repository directly in IntelliJ IDEA:

. Open the product you want to store in a repository.
. On the main menu, choose VCS | Import into Version Control | Create Git Repository.
. In the dialog that opens, specify the directory where you want to create a new Git repository.
. Put the required files under Git version control.
The files appear in the Local Changes tab of the Version Control tool window, under the Default change list.

[TIP]
====
You can define the set of files which should be ignored by git in the _.gitignore_ configuration file.
See https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore[gitignore] for details.

Your IDE shall support this feature and would add files or folder to ignore through its user interface.
====

=== Commit Changes

To commit your changes you simply

[source,shell]
----
git commit -m "commit message, should be clear and legible"
----

You can perform these operations directly in IntelliJ IDEA (VCS functions) with these instructions.
Switch to the Version Control tool window and switch to the Local Changes tab.
. Expand the Un-versioned Files node, and select the files to be added.
From the context menu, choose _to Add to VCS_, or press ⌥⌘A.
. Switch to the Project tool window and select the files to be added.
From the context menu, choose Git | Add or press⌥⌘A.

Each time you commit your changes, you gain the ability to reverse back to exactly this state.
Each time you made a modification and tested it, just commit it.
The cost of a commit is marginal.
When working with Git, TDD, and ATDD, it is normal to commit every few minutes.
By few minutes we mean 5 or 10 minutes.

Observe yourself.
If you commit at the end of the day, you are using your DVCS as a backup medium.
It is time to change your habits.
Use Git as a history of all successful changes you implement, and simply rollback all unsuccessful ones, simply discarding them.

=== What is Your Project Status?

To find out what the status of your product is, simply

[source,shell]
----
git status
----

The same information is available in IntelliJ IDEA under

. Open the required product
. On the main menu, choose VCS | Refresh File Status
. Switch to the Version Control window and open the Local Changes tab.

=== Always Work with Trunk

Ideally, you shall always work against trunk, also called the main branch.
Because you develop using TDD and ATTD approaches, you know your source code is always working.
This approach is deeply compatible with lean and agile values.
It is also the one with the least waste of effort.

If your team decides to work with branches, make them short-lived!.
See How to link:../../2016/git-branches-for-the-impatient/[Git Branches for the Impatient] post.

=== Discarding Changes

You find you the changes you made locally were not a good decision.
No problem, with

[source,shell]
----
git reset --hard
----

You revert to the last save-committed set of files.
Resetting with the hard option recursively discards all of your currently uncommitted (unstaged or staged) changes.

You want to restore just one file to its previous committed state.

[source,shell]
----
git checkout --[filename]
----

=== Configuration Tips

You shall avoid the end of online character warnings by configuring git to handle them.
The situation arises because Microsoft OS uses CRLF for the end of lines instead of CR.

You can configure git to handle it by running on Windows.

[source,shell]
----
git config --global core.autocrlf true
----

or on Linux and macOS

[source,shell]
----
git config --global core.autocrlf input
----

When using an IDE consider the https://editorconfig.org[Editor Configuration] approach for the end of line, indentation and tabs versus spaces.
