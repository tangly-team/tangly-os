I hosted my technical blogs on https://www.blogger.com/[blogger] for years.

If I correctly remember, I started to use blogger ten years ago.
It was a good choice at that time.

I could easily write blogs and publish them.

It is a great tool with some drawbacks.
Over the years, the deficiencies sting more and more
--

The major drawbacks are:

* Their editor is brittle, with limited functionality and unreliable.
The generated HTML is not legible and does not support concepts such as micro fragments, meta information or simple functions such as source code highlighting.
* The last quarter, they started to tinker with their editor and output format.
My older posts are now a mess and can only be open in the HTML mode.
If I switch to their WYSIWYG editor, the layout is destroyed and random fonts family and sizes are displayed.
Worse, the blogs are also displayed mangled to the readers even if I do not edit them.
This destruction of all older blogs and the missing migration path were killer criteria.
* Blogger does not support modern markup language such https://www.markdownguide.org/[Markdown] or {ref-asciidoc}.
Blogger uses a proprietary and not easy to port format.

It is *time* to find an alternative, and I have to confess I am a huge fan of {ref-asciidoc}.

OK, so why not go with Markdown?
Don’t get me wrong, there is nothing bad with Markdown; except that no one should probably use it when {ref-asciidoc} and Asciidoctor are available.
I’m writing all my documents with {ref-asciidoc}
footnote:[You find tutorials how to write asciidoc documentation and how to use the toolchain on YouTube and Udemy.].

The following needs are identified:

. I shall write blogs with the selected solution.
The blogs shall be written in {ref-asciidoc}.
The blog platform should support multiple years of publishing and referencing between blogs.
Our projects and our collaborators put effort to regularly publish articles.
. I shall be able to write technical articles and publish them on the same site.
The articles are naturally written in {ref-asciidoc}.
We want professional looking documentation to encourage new users to try our open source components.
. I shall publish the technical documentation of the open source components I develop on the same site.

{ref-hugo} was selected as static site generator because its support for {ref-asciidoc} is tremendously improving.

Static website generators have strong advantages for technical savvy people:

* Hosting is cheap.
GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket pages even host static websites for free.
* The source files go into {ref-git} for backup and history.
* The source files are in plain text:
** Changes come in as a _Pull Request_ for proper review and CI pipeline validation.
** The sources are open in our IDEs, which encourages refactoring them alongside the code.
This results in less stale content.

First I used the https://github.com/thingsym/hugo-theme-techdoc/[hugo-theme-techdoc] to customize {ref-hugo}.
It worked great for the technical documentation and technical articles but fell short of my wishes for the blog part.
When I discover the theme {ref-docsy}.
It supports the technical documentation, technical articles, and blogging.

The best part is that {ref-hugo} now supports {ref-asciidoctor} natively.
No more strange manipulation to load _gem_ modules you need.
And diagrams through asciidoc-diagram and plantUml are generated in the expected folders.
The documentation is still on the light side, but you find the need information on the various pull requests.

The bonus is that {ref-asciidoctor} newer versions have native support for _rouge_ syntax highlighter.
It is no more necessary to load _pygment_ highlighter and configure CSS files.
Another huge gain is that _plantuml_ and other diagrams are generated at the right location.

== Install the Tools

My development platform is a MacBookPro and macOS.
I use https://brew.sh/[Homebrew] as a package manager.

The instructions to install hugo and asciidoctor are:

[source,console]
----
brew install hugo                         # <1>

brew install asciidoctor                  # <2>
gem install asciidoctor-diagram
gem install asciidoctor-rouge
gem install asciidoctor-bibtex
gem install asciimath

brew install plantuml                     # <3>
brew install graphviz

sudo npm install -D --save autoprefixer   # <4>
sudo npm install -D --save postcss-cli
sudo npm install -D --save postcss
----

<1> Install https://gohugo.io/[hugo] application
<2> Install https://asciidoctor.org/[asciidoctor] and additional asciidoctor packages
<3> Install https://plantuml.com/[plantuml] and https://graphviz.org/[graphviz] for diagrams, in particular UML sketches
<4> Install https://postcss.org/[PostCSS] and additional packages used by docsy to generate deployment site.
See also https://www.docsy.dev/docs/getting-started/[docsy documentation].

=== Asciidoctor Configuration

Below the configuration of asciidoctor in the _config.toml_ file.

[source,yaml]
----
[markup.asciidocext]
  extensions = ["asciidoctor-html5s", "asciidoctor-diagram"]
  workingFolderCurrent = true
  [markup.asciidocext.attributes]
    imagesdir = "../pics"
    source-highlighter = "rouge"            // <1>
    rouge-style = "github"                  // <2>
    rouge-css = "style"                     // <3>
    icons = "font"                          // <4>
    ref-less = "https://less.works/[LeSS]"  // <5>
----

<1> Select https://rouge-ruby.github.io/docs/[rouge] as source highlighter.
You should not add it to the extensions because since {ref-asciidoctor} version 2.0 rouge is included.
<2> Define the style used to highlight source code.
<3> Configure rouge to generate all formatting data into the generated HTML file, avoiding any CSS file configuration.
<4> Icons provide better looking icons for various {ref-asciidoc}} constructs.
<5> Define document attributes which are accessible to all processed documents (DRY concepts for the whole site).

CAUTION

====
Newer versions of hugo have stricter security restrictions.
You must explicitly enable asciidoctor support by adding the following statements in your configuration file

[source,yaml]
----
[security]
[security.exec]
allow = ['^dart-sass-embedded$', '^go$', '^npx$', '^postcss$', '^asciidoctor$']
----

====

=== Docsy Configuration

==== Add First Level Folders

Each time you add your own first level folder – meaning at the same level as docs, blog, about, or community, you need to extend the layout to support it.
For example, I store technical articles in the folder ideas and use the standard template.
So I need to add (if not, no items are visible in the sidebar).

[source,console]
----
cp -R ./layouts/docs ./layouts/ideas
----

==== Change layouts

We had to change the partial _footer.html_ to display a better looking copyright clause.
The original version has hard coded text not really compatible with the creative commons license we are using.
The layout is updated by overwriting the involved partial file.

[source,console]
----
cp $prjDir/src/site/website/docsy/layouts/partials/footer.html $siteDir/themes/docsy/layouts/partials
----

=== Enable Local Search Engine

One cool feature of {ref-docsy} is local search support through https://lunrjs.com/[lunrjs] engine.

[source,yaml]
----
algolia_docsearch = false

offlineSearch = true
offlineSearchSummaryLength = 200
offlineSearchMaxResults = 25
----

== Learning

The static website is published under {ref-site}.

The source of the whole website is available under https://bitbucket.org/tangly-team/tangly-os/src/master/src/site/website/[Website Source Code].

Printing of a single article is supported through your browser.
You can configure printing a whole section with or without a table of contents through https://www.docsy.dev/docs/adding-content/print/[configuration options].
For advanced cases, you can define the layout of the printed document.

You can use relative links in your {ref-asciidoc} documents.
Beware where the files are located by {ref-hugo} engine and the naming conventions shall follow {ref-hugo} rules.

Avoid the specialized but uncompleted _html5s_ backend and use instead the _html5_ backend.
I was not able to find good examples of stylesheets for the semantic backend.
The _html5s_ backend uses new names for classification and sometimes different HTML structures.
The regular available stylesheets will not style correctly the generated website.

The Docsy theme does not explicitly support asciidoc documents and the associated stylesheets.
I had to extend the Docsy stylesheets with styling for admonition blocks, quote blocks, and embedded images to improve the quality of the texts.

NOTE: The Hugo theme community is slow to better support asciidoc documents.
The Hugo developers clearly stated that styling for asciidoc documents is the responsibility of theme authors.
All Hugo users shall be aware that asciidoc is an officially supported input format.

Funny is that the blogger software and the docsy theme are from the same company as *Google*.

_This blog article is naturally written in {ref-asciidoc} syntax_.
