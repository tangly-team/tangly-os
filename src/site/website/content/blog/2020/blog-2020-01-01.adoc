When https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming[eXtreme Programming] first came out, one expectation it worked hard to set is who gets to make what
calls on software projects.

For example, business has the right to know how long something is going to take and when it can expect things to be done.

Conversely, developers have the right to know what the priorities are, and to be able to do good work.

To that end, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming[eXtreme Programming] created the *Customer and Development Team Bill of Rights*.

=== Customer Bill of Rights

You have the right

* To an _overall plan_, to know what can be accomplished when and at what cost.
* To get the _most possible value out of every programming week_.
* To see _progress in a running system_, proven to work by passing _repeatable tests_ that you specify.
* To _change your mind_, to substitute functionality, and to change priorities _without paying exorbitant costs_.
* To be informed of _schedule changes_, in time to choose how to reduce the scope to restore the original date.
* _To cancel at any time and be left with a useful working system_ reflecting investment to date.

=== Developer Bill of Rights

You have the right

* To know _what is needed_, with clear declarations of priority.
* To produce _quality work at all times_.
* _To ask for and receive help from peers, managers, and customers_.
* _To make and update your own estimates_.
* _To accept your responsibilities_ instead of having them assigned to you.

=== Calibration

You shall use the above bill of rights to evolve the cooperation between the development teams and the customers and improve the product value.
See if:

. Your customer has an overall plan with scheduled functionalities and costs.
 Your development team can schedule changes and update the estimates.
. Your customer has at any time a running and tested application.
 Your development team always produces quality work.
. Your customer can cancel at any time the development initiative.
 Your development team receives help from peers, managers and customers.
. Your customer and the development team accept responsibilities.

Dysfunctions are easy to detect

. Customers are not involved in the development initiative on a daily basis.
. The development team does not pursue craftsmanship and quality.
. Customers cannot cancel an initiative at any time, The development team cannot update their estimates.
. Management force responsibilities upon collaborators.

Observe your organization and start to improve.
The above rules are here to detect and truly improve your organization toward building products, which delight the customers <<detecting-agile-bullshit>>.
