A software architect models customer domains and maps them to powerful software abstractions.
Soon you correlate internal efficient identifiers, meaningful external identifiers, and domain entities.
You enjoy our long conversations with the enterprise data architect and find out the system owning a specific external identifier.

How do you relate to external systems and communicate with other companies?

How do you define internal identifiers, which grow with application success?

How can you bridge the customer world with your software solution?

What are the good practices to create a maintainable, legible and efficient model of your domain model?
--

== Entity Concept

We need an approach to model customer domain entities and map them to a legible and maintainable software construct.

An entity is a user domain model abstraction and is mapped to a software type.

* Any entity has a _unique mandatory internal_ object identifier *_oid_*, we recommend the use of numeric values to improve performance.
* Public and _external identifier_ *_id_*, we recommend the use of text to adequately support various external identification schemes.
An example is the European enterprise identifier EUID identifying a company or a certified natural person in Europe
* Human-readable _name_.

A more sophisticated variant provides additional features.

* A set of tags to classify the instance through a crowd based ontology.
Tags are often called labels.
* A list of comments to add human-readable information to the instance.
Comments have a timeline and can be sorted by creation date.
The comments can be extended to add audit information such as functional change information or activities related to the instance.

These entity features should be defined as a set of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixin[mixin] interfaces.

== Internal Object Identifiers _oid_

The object identifier _oid_ uniquely identifies an instance in a given context.
This identifier shall be a numerical value to increase the performance of persistent solutions.
It is used as an internal identifier in the application.
It should never be visible outside the system or published through an API.

Ideally, the identifier is universally valid and uniquely identifies an instance in all contexts.
For example, the concept of UUID tries to provide such an identifier.
The drawback is that UUID is not a numerical value and cumbersome for a developer to memorize.

[NOTE]
====
An interesting approach is to support unique identifiers in the context of a bounded domain.
All entities of the domain will have unique object identifier.
The implementation can use a sequence from the domain database or schema.
A programmatic identity generator can also be established in the domain.

Because the _oid_ is never exported, the solution is as powerful and simple to realize.
====

History has taught developers not to spare on the size of identifiers.
Please use a long value meaning 64 bits.

Avoid using the internal identifier to communicate with external systems.
If you respect this rule, you are free to migrate your objects to another identification scheme in the future.
New schemes are often helpful when the application grows, or you have later to import and take over a lot of legacy data.

== External Object Identifiers _id_

The external unique identifier id shall uniquely identify an entity instance.
It is used as an external identifier to communicate with other systems.
It should always be visible outside the system and used in any API.

Try to have exactly one external identifier per object to communicate with external systems.
This restriction is a corollary of the rule stating an instance is owned by exactly one system.
This system is the one defining and managing the external unique identifiers.

You should clearly define the owning system for the external identification scheme.
This information shall be documented and accessible to all involved parties.
This process is part of the enterprise architecture activities of your ecosystem.

External identifier ownership is often a murky situation when working with legacy systems.
You often have multiple sources of external identifiers, sometimes overlapping and sometimes not covering all instances.
You have to formulate a long-term strategy to clean up your landscape and handle the problems until these clean-up activities are completed.
By handling, we mean administrative and import rules matching the various external identifiers to the same object.

One possible solution is to use tags.
Store externally defined identifiers as tags.
Document these tags as specific for the external system.
This approach scales to multiple external identifiers, and multiple systems managing the same external identifier.
So you have a scalable approach and do not pollute your domain model with spurious information defined in external systems.
Upon completion of refactoring, these tags document historical information and could safely be removed.

Multiple external object identifiers imply the existence of mapping functions to identify the object referenced.
Because the ownership of external identifiers is outside your system, you are dependent on these systems and have to hope they are good citizens.
The key rule of good systems is that they never change external identifiers.
As soon as you modify identifiers, they are per definition no more real identifiers.

== Names _name_

The entity name is a human-readable name to distinguish between entity instances.
Ideally, it should be almost unique.
The fallback is to use the external unique identifier _id_ known to all external systems.
The drawback is that we have no guarantee it is legible for users.
Names are essential for well-designed user interfaces.
Never require from your users memorizing external identifiers, please provide names.

For example, the first and last names of a person is the name for a natural entity.
Social security number is a possible external identifier.
An internal identifier is used as a primary key in the persistence storage.

== Advices

. Internal object identifiers are identifiers.
An identifier is immutable and should be numerical for performance reasons.
. External object identifiers have exactly one application in charge to create them.
. Names are human-readable and improve the legibility and usability of the user interface and reports.

External identifiers can be tricky.
In Switzerland, we had an old social security number, which is still referenced in a lot of legal systems.
For example, it is still part of your tax salary yearly form.

[NOTE]
====
Identifiers are a key element to model entities using the domain driven design _DDD_ approach.
====

We have a new social security number, which is used in social insurance workflows.
_The same number is also used in medical insurance workflows._

We also have a federal identity card number, a federal passport number, a federal driver license number, additional medical card insurance numbers, a state tax personal identification number, and more external identifiers.
All these external identifiers shall reference the same natural person.

More interesting is that a tourist living in the European zone has none of these numbers.

Please implement the internal identifier feature as an interface marker.
The external identifier and name features can be grouped into one interface.

Below the source code in modern Java is:

[source,java]
----
public interface HasOid {
    long oid();
}

public interface HasId extends HasOid {
    String id();
    void id(String id);
    String name();
    void name(String name);
}
----

We provide a Java library BUS implementing these constructs.
More information is available under https://blog.tangly.net/[tangly open source components].

== Extensions

See our blog how to extend the entity concept with the powerful and flexible concepts of tags and comment approaches.

Another blog shows a constrained form of tags using the concept of reference codes also called reference tables or lookup tables.
