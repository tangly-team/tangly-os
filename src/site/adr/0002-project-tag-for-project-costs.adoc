= 1. Use Tag for per project costs computation

Date: 2017-12-01

== Status

Implemented

== Context

We would like to compute earnings and costs on per project base.
Each transaction entry should support tags to identify the associated projects or departments.
The tag approach supports multiple consolidation of an orthogonal cost structure.

== Decision

We will support tags at the transaction entry.
The tags are a triplet *[namespace:]name[=value]* format.
We recommend the namespace "fin", the name "segment", and a text identifier has value.

== Consequences

* Ontology based on tags are not hard defined through a type system.
* Checks have to be implemented to guaranty adequate level of tracking.
