== Object-Orientation

image::oo-concepts.png[background,size="60%"]

Object-orientation rules the software world.

The programming languages {cpp}, Java, C#, Python, Typescript, Ruby, Switft, Rust, or Delphi includes object-orientation features.

=== What is an Object?

An *object* has three capabilities:

- Identity _is unique in the system_
- State _is composed of attributes_
- Behavior _is defined with methods_

[.notes]
--
An object shall represent a physical instance or a clear abstraction.
--

=== What is a Class?

- A *class* is a template for a set objects. +
It defines the available attributes and their type. +
It declares the behavior of the objects.
- An *interface* is a behavior template.
- An *abstract class* defines state and behavor.
It cannot have instances.
- Primitive types have no identity.

[.notes]
--
Primitive objects are equivalent if they have the same attributes.
You cannot distinguish multiple equivalent primitives objects.

Two objects can always be distinguished through their identities.
--

=== Advanced Approaches

- Templates are classes with generic types and constants.
- Mixins are a kind of interfaces or abstract classes.
They codify an orthogonal abstraction.

== Why Do You Model?

- Designing is an activity
- A design represents an artifact representing some findings.
This artifact is obsolete when you continue designing.
- The model codifies your findings and partially describes the implementation.

[.notes]
--
The primary value is communication and understanding.
You can sketch, blueprint and program with UML.

Sketching is active (forward to and backward from the code).
Blueprinting is dubious.
Programming approach is dead (MDA is obsolete).
--

=== Software Design Principles

- Modularity
- Cohesion
- Separation of concerns
- Information hiding
- Abstraction

[.notes]
--
These concepts are discussed and applied since the sixties in the last century.
They are implied in any good object-oriented design.
--

[.columns]
=== Idioms

[.column.is-three-fifths]
--
The design is constrained by

- The technology stack
- The team capabilities
- The non-functional requirements
--

[.notes]
--
It is a fallacy to pretend that your solution is independent of the technology stack and programming language.
The design shall follow the programmatic idioms and build on the strength of the selected technology stack.
--

=== Functional Approaches

- Functions are first-class citizens
- Functions can be variables, parameters, and return values

Design patterns such as the visitor, strategy or factory pattern are easily implemented with functions.

=== UML and C4

- {ref-uml} is the modeling approach for object-oriented systems originating in the eighties
- {ref-c4} is a simplification to the exploding complexity of UML 2.5
- Choose the tools empowering you to create the optimal design for your product

[.notes]
--
The standardization of UML was around 1995.
--

=== UML Diagram Types

image::uml-diagram-types.jpg[]

[.notes]
--
Structure diagrams show the things in the modeled system.
In a more technical term, they show different objects in a system.
Behavioral diagrams show what should happen in a system.
They describe how the objects interact with each other to create a functioning system.

I use

Structure Diagrams:: class diagram, sometimes the component diagram
Behavior Diagras:: state machine diagram, sequence diagram, sometimes the communication diagram

I prefer

- Customer journeys over use case diagram
- Textual descriptions over deployment diagram or package diagram
--

== Class Diagram

image::uml-class-diagram.svg[]

// [plantuml,uml-class-diagram,svg]
// ----
// @startuml
// interface Actor <<Active>> {
//   + {static} send(Actor actor, Message message)
//   + String name()
//   # receive(Message message)
//   # {abstract} process(Message message)
// }
// class Queue<T> {}
//
// class Message <<struct>> {}
//
// enum MessageType
//
// Message *-- "1" MessageType : type
//
// Actor *- "1" Queue : messages
// Queue .> Message
//
// class ActorCpp {}
// Actor <|.. ActorCpp
//
// class ActorCmsis {}
// Actor <|.. ActorCmsis
//
// @enduml
// ----

=== Relations

- Association _shows a dependency between two class_
- Inheritance _extends a class_
- Realization _implements an interface_
- Dependency _uses a class_
- Aggregation _instance has other objects_
- Composition _lifecycle is the same_

[.notes]
--
Avoid bidirectional associations.
Dependencies can have keywords to refine them: call, create, derive, instantiate, permit, realize, refine, substitute, trace, use.
--

=== Properties and Methods

- Properties define the state of an object
- Methods define the behavior of an object

A big chunk of the source code is the implementation of methods.

[.notes]
--
Properties are called attributes in UML.
--

=== Visibility and Specifiers

- private, package-private, protected, public
- static
- abstract
- derived
- \{readonly}

[.columns]
=== Advanced Topics

[.column]
- Property default value, cardinality, ordered
- Association roles
- Constraints _{...}_
- Stereotypes

[.column]
- Tags
- Notes
- Navigability

[.notes]
--
Use notes to specify constraints on class or relations.
If you are a purist, try OCL _Object Constraint Language_.

Reflect on _Design by Contract_ with pre-condition, post-condition, and invariant.
--

=== Thoughts

- Class diagrams visualize the object-oriented structure of your source code
- Their value is the abstraction to highlight key concepts
- Details are available in the source code

[.notes]
--
In general, it is impossible to declare all the details of the source code in class diagrams.
Modern programming languages have too many features and idioms.
--

== Component Diagram

- defines the structure of the architecture in components
- distribution structure such as libraries and executables
- source code structure

[.notes]
--
A component diagram displays the structural relationship for the components of a software system.
These are mostly used when working with complex systems with many components.
Components communicate with each other using interfaces.
The interfaces are linked using connectors.

Java or C++ modules are components.
--

=== Component Diagram

image::uml-component-diagram.svg[]

// [plantuml,uml-component-diagram,svg]
// ....
// package "Application" {
//   HTTP - [Loader]
//   [Process Manager]
// }
// rectangle "Drivers" {
//   FTP - [Second Component]
//   [First Component] --> FTP
// }
// cloud {
//   [Maintenance]
// }
// database "Persistence" {
//   folder "Configuration Data" {
//     [Configuration]
//   }
//   frame "Logger" {
//     [Trace]
//   }
// }
// ....

=== Thoughts

- Provide an overview to highlight your component structure
- Beware that modern programming languages support a textual representation of this structure

== Package Diagram

- structure of source code in package and modules.
You can show your layered architecture with a package diagram.

[.notes]
--
As the name suggests, a package diagram shows the dependencies between different packages in a system.
--

== Deployment Diagram

- physical distribution of artifacts on nodes, cores, and processes
- Communication between nodes

[.notes]
--
A deployment diagram shows the hardware of your system and the software in that hardware.
Deployment diagrams are useful when your software solution is deployed across multiple machines with each having a unique configuration.
--

== Object Diagram

- A set of concrete instances of classes and their relations
- Sequence diagram
- Communication diagram

[.notes]
--
Object Diagrams, sometimes referred to as instance diagrams, are very similar to class diagrams.
Like class diagrams, they also show the relationship between objects, but they use real-world examples.

They show what a system will look like at a given time.
Because there is data available in the objects, they are used to explain complex relationships between objects.

In UML version 1, communication diagrams were called collaboration diagrams.
Communication diagrams are similar to sequence diagrams, but the focus is on messages passed between objects.
The same information can be represented using a sequence diagram and different objects.
--

=== Sequence Diagram

image:uml-sequence-diagram.svg[]

// [plantuml,uml-sequence-diagram,svg]
// ....
// participant User
// User -> Engine: DoWork
// activate Engine
// Engine -> Receipt: << createRequest >>
// activate Engine
// Receipt -> Interpreter: DoWork
// activate Interpreter
// Interpreter --> Receipt: WorkDone
// destroy Interpreter
// Receipt --> Engine: RequestCreated
// deactivate Receipt
// Engine -> User: Done
// deactivate Engine
// ....

[.notes]
--
Sequence diagrams in UML show how objects interact with each other and the order those interactions occur.
It is important to note that they show the interactions for a particular scenario.
The processes are represented vertically and interactions are shown as arrows.
--

=== Advanced Concepts

- Activation frames
- Synchronous and asynchronous calls
- Return values
- Interaction Frames
- Creation and deletion of instances

== State Machine Diagram

=== Rules

- A state machine is inside a class
- Events are asynchronous messages
- Avoid activities and concurrent states
- Timeout requires a global time provider

[.notes]
--
Design your system so that you do not have any concurrent state.

Flat state machines can be implemented with a double switch.
Hierarchical state machines require a nested set or at least a table representation if you have no history states.
--

=== State Machine Diagram

image:uml-state-diagram.svg[]

// [plantuml,uml-state-diagram,svg]
// ....
// hide empty description
//
// state Root {
//     [*] --> Off
//     state Maintenance
//     Maintenance -> Off : TogglePower / MaintainedToOff
//
//     state Off
//     Off -> Maintenance : TogglePower [Maintenance is On] / log transition Off to Maintenance
//     Off -> On : TogglePower [Maintenance Off] / OffToOn
//
//
//     state On {
//         [*] --> DAB
//         state DAB
//         DAB -> FM : ToggleMode / DABToFM
//
//         state FM {
//             [*] --> Play
//             state Play
//             Play -> AutoTune : StationLost / PlayToAutoTune
//
//             state AutoTune
//             AutoTune -> Play : StationFound / AutoTuneToPlay
//
//             FM -> DAB : ToggleMode / FMToDAB
//         }
//
//         On -> Off : TogglePower / OnToOff
//     }
// }
// ....


== Requirements Aspects

- Use case diagram
- Activity diagram

=== Use Case Diagram

image:uml-use-case-diagram.svg[]

// [plantuml,uml-use-case-diagram,svg]
// ....
// left to right direction
//
// actor developer
// database repo as "central\nrepo"
// agent jenkins as "Jenkins"
//
// rectangle admin as "Gerrit / Gitlab" {
//     agent ui as "front"
//     database repo_local as "local\nrepo"
// }
//
// developer --> ui : push
// ui --> repo_local : push
// ui -left-> jenkins: "\npush "
// ui ..> repo : replication
// ....

[.notes]
--
As the most known diagram type of the behavioral UML types, use case diagrams give a graphic overview of the actors involved in a system, different functions needed by those actors and how these different functions interact.
--

=== Activity Diagram

image:uml-activity-diagram.svg[]

// [plantuml,uml-activity-diagram,svg]
// ....
// (*) --> "Initialization"
//
// if "Some Test" then
//   -->[true] "Some Activity"
//   --> "Another activity"
//   -right-> (*)
// else
//   ->[false] "Something else"
//   -->[Ending process] (*)
// endif
// ....

[.notes]
--
Activity diagrams represent workflows in a graphical way.
They can be used to describe the business workflow or the operational workflow of any component in a system.

I recommend using {ref-bpml} _Business Process Modeling Language_ notation to describe workflows.
Agile approaches prefer customer journeys and event storming.
--

== Embedded Considerations

- Heap and Dynamic Object Allocations
- Threads
- Interrupt Routines

== UML and C4

The {ref-c4}  is:

. A set of hierarchical abstractions: software systems **c**ontext, **c**ontainers, **c**omponents, and **c**ode
. A set of hierarchical diagrams: system context, containers, components, and code
. Notation and tooling independent

[.notes]
--
The C4 model is an easy to learn, developer-friendly approach to software architecture diagramming.
Good software architecture diagrams assist with communication inside/outside of software development/product teams.
It supports efficient onboarding of new staff, architecture reviews, risk identification, threat modeling, etc.
--

=== System Context Diagram

image:c4-system-context.png[]

[.notes]
--
A System Context diagram is a good starting point for diagramming and documenting a software system, allowing you to step back and see the big picture.
Draw a diagram showing your system as a box in the center, surrounded by its users and the other systems that it interacts with.

Detail is not important here as this is your zoomed-out view showing a big picture of the system landscape.
The focus should be on people such as actors, roles, personas and software systems rather than technologies, protocols and other low-level details.
It's the sort of diagram that you could show to non-technical people.
--

=== Container Diagram

image:c4-containers.png[]

[.notes]
--
Once you understand how your system fits in to the overall IT environment, a really useful next step is to zoom-in to the system boundary with a Container diagram.
A "container" is something like a server-side web application, single-page application, desktop application, mobile app, database schema, file system, etc.
Essentially, a container is a separately runnable/deployable unit such as a separate process space that executes code or stores data.

The Container diagram shows the high-level shape of the software architecture and how responsibilities are distributed across it.
It also shows the major technology choices and how the containers communicate with one another.
It is a simple, high-level technology focussed diagram that is useful for software developers and support/operations staff alike.
--

=== Component Diagram

image:c4-components.png[]

[.notes]
--
Next, you can zoom in and decompose each container further to identify the major structural building blocks and their interactions.

The Component diagram shows how a container is made up of a number of "components".
It describes what each of those components is, their responsibilities and the technology/implementation details.
--

=== Code Diagram

image:c4-class-diagram.png[]

[.notes]
--
Finally, you can zoom in to each component to show how it is implemented as code; using UML class diagrams, entity relationship diagrams or similar.

This is an optional level of detail and is often available on-demand from tooling such as IDEs.
Ideally, this diagram would be automatically generated using tooling such as an IDE or UML modeling tool.
You should consider showing only those attributes and methods that allow you to tell the story that you want to tell.
This level of detail is not recommended for anything but the most important or complex components.
--

=== Advanced Diagrams

- System Landscape Diagram
- Dynamic Diagram
- Deployment Diagram

=== Thoughts

Although the example diagrams above are created using a _boxes and lines_ notation, the core diagrams can be illustrated using UML.

[.notes]
--
The resulting UML diagrams tend to lack the same degree of a descriptive text, because adding such text is not easy with most UML tools.
