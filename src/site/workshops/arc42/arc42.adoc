=== What is Software Architecture?

[quote,Grady Booch]
____
All architectures are design, but not all designs are architecture.

Architecture represents the set of significant design decisions that shape the form and the function of a system, where significant is measured by the cost of change.
____

=== Ideas

[%step]
What should we document and communicate about our architecture?

[%step]
How should we document and communicate it in an agile environment?

[%step]
How can we minimize the effort for the software architecture documentation?

[%step]
How can stakeholders access the versioned documentation?

[.notes]
--
- {ref-arc42} is a pretty minimalistic documentation template compared to other templates.
The template provides a clear structure to your software architecture document.
- No matter how big your project is, it keeps the documentation relatively slim and maintainable.
- The code is the architecture.
Drawings and documents are a picture of what the authors thought the architecture is.
- Tension between software architecture and regulatory aspects.
--

=== Known Problems

- Not existing or outdated documents
- Confusing and without a clear structure
- Process-oriented instead of result-oriented +
_How instead of Why_
- *Painful to maintain*

[.notes]
--
- Outdated software architecture documents _SAD_ are often encountered
- No clear purpose of the documentation.
What is the target audience?
- Often too many texts and diagrams.
- Cumbersome to maintain with inadequate tools and processes.
--

[.lightbg,background-opacity="0.25"]
=== Concepts

image::00-software-documentation.jpg[background,size=cover]

- Documentation as code under version management
- Optimized for understandability and adequacy
- Developers are interested to create and maintain the documents with manageable effort
- Follow standard to reduce training and internal resistance

[.notes]
--
- You only describe things that your stakeholders really have to know.
- You explain facts and issues that are necessary to understand the system or individual design decisions.
- You only keep track of important architecture decision that you had to make anyhow.
- arc42 is lean and lightweight.
--

=== arc42 Sections

image::00_arc42-overview.png[]

== 1 - https://docs.arc42.org/section-1/[Introduction and Goals]

image::01-intro-and-goals.png[width=640,height=200,float="center"]

- Business goals and essential features
- A short description of the requirements
- A few quality goals for the architecture
- List of important stakeholders and expectations

[.notes]
--
- The purpose of the product in Scrum described in the vision, portfolio planning, product roadmap, release plan, backlog.
- A customer journey with key scenarios.
Reflect if behavior-driven development and automated tests is a viable approach.
- Quality tree for fitness functions.
Try to identify the top five quality goals for the architecture.
See ISO 25010 for potential goals.
Section 10 will refine these goals.
--

===  1: Tips

[cols="1,1",options="header"]
|===
^s|Prefer|Avoid
|Provide context | Do not skip this
|Cover the important bits | Avoid going into details
|Use diagrams _C4, UML_ | Do not make this too long
|Use concrete examples _specification by example_ | Avoid verbosity
|===

[.notes]
--
- Professional software developers know {ref-uml} and {ref-c4}.
Minimize the cognitive load and use established notations.
- Specification by Example is a natural path to behavior-driven development and acceptance criteria in Scrum stories.
--

==  2 - https://docs.arc42.org/section-2/[Constraints]

image::02-constraints-overview.png[width=640,height=200,float="center"]

Anything that constrains teams in design and implementation decisions.

- Environmental and legal aspects
- Company-wide or organizational constraints
- Technical limitations

[.notes]
--
- Architects should understand legal and technical constraints
- Look at the constraints of other systems within the organization
- Document the consequences of imposed constraints
--

== 3 - https://docs.arc42.org/section-3/[Context and Scope]

image::03-context-overview.png[width=640,height=200,float="center"]

- Separate your system from its external systems and users.
- Specify the external interfaces shown either in a business and technical perspectives.
- List of communication interfaces

[.notes]
--
- C4 context diagram is very good to document your system boundaries.
Show all external interfaces.
- Explicitly indicate risks and quality requirements.
- Defer technical context to the deployment section.
--

=== 3: Tips

- Select tools which can be integrated into our continuous delivery pipeline
- Prefer artifacts you can store in {ref-git}
- Follow standards

[.notes]
--
- Do not use https://subversion.apache.org/[Subversion].
It was a great tool and should rest in peace.
--

== 4 - https://docs.arc42.org/section-4/[Solution Strategy]

image::04-solution-strategy-overview.svg[width=640,height=100,float="center"]

Fundamental decisions and solution strategies

- Technology decisions
- Top-level decomposition
- Approaches to achieve top quality goals
- Relevant organizational decisions such as the development process

[.notes]
--
- These decisions form the cornerstones of your architecture.
- Let the solution strategy grow incrementally and interactively.
- Justify the solution strategy.
--

==  5: https://docs.arc42.org/section-5/[Building Block View]

image::05-building-block-overview.png[width=640,height=200,float="center"]

A static decomposition of the system, shown as hierarchy of white boxes up to the right level of abstraction.
Elements are modules, components, subsystems, classes, interfaces, libraries, frameworks, or partitions.

[.notes]
--
- Maintain an overview of your source code by making its structure understandable through abstraction.
This allows you to communicate with your stakeholder on an abstract level without disclosing implementation details.
- Multiple levels of diagrams can be provided.
--

=== Historical Background

UML and {ref-4-1-view} heavily influence the arc42 approach.

image::05-4_1_view_of_sw_architecture.png[float="center"]

[.notes]
--
- Scenarios: section 1: Introduction and goals
- Logical view: section 3: Context and Scope, section 5: Building Block view
- Process view: section 6: Runtime view
- Deployment view: section 7: Deployment view
- Physical view: section 7: Deployment view
--

=== C4

{ref-c4} is a model is a set of hierarchical abstractions

- https://c4model.com/#SystemContextDiagram[System Context View] _shows the system scope_
- https://c4model.com/#ContainerDiagram[Container View] _decomposes the applications and data stores_
- https://c4model.com/#ComponentDiagram[Component View] _decomposes containers into interrelated components_
- https://c4model.com/#CodeDiagram[Code View] _provides details about the design and is based on UML_

[.notes]
--
The optional diagrams are:
- https://c4model.com/#SystemLandscapeDiagram[System Landscape Diagram].
- https://c4model.com/#DynamicDiagram[Dynamic Diagram].
- https://c4model.com/#DeploymentDiagram[Deployment Diagram].
--

=== System Context Diagrams

=== Container Diagrams

image::C4-Container.png[width=960,height=640,float="center"]

=== Component Diagrams

image::C4-Component.png[width=960,height=640,float="center"]

=== Code Diagrams

image::C4-Code.png[width=960,height=640,float="center"]

== 6 - https://docs.arc42.org/section-6/[Runtime View]

image::06-runtime-overview.png[width=640,height=200,float="center"]

Behavior of building blocks as scenarios, covering use cases, operation, administration, error handeling and features.

Examples for this might be UML sequence, activity or state machine diagrams.

[.notes]
--
- Document only a few runtime scenarios.
--

=== 6 - Tips

- Runtime scenarios explain important application behavior
- Maintaining runtime scenarios is expensive
- You often can explain behavior with unit tests to document how the system behaves

== 7 - https://docs.arc42.org/section-7/[Deployment View]

image::07-deployment-overview.png[width=640,height=200,float="center"]

The technical infrastructure with environments, servers and topologies.

Mapping of building blocks to the right infrastructure.

UML offers deployment diagrams to express that view

[.notes]
--
- Document your hardware architecture.
- Architects should have knowledge of hardware and operating system aspects.
- Modern applications are described with Docker or Kubernetes composition textual configurations.
--

[.lightbg,background-opacity="0.2"]
=== 7 - Tips

image::07-docker-compose.png[background,size=cover]

- You can often describe your system topology with a {ref-docker} compose file.
- API are described with {ref-openapi}.

== 8 - https://docs.arc42.org/section-8/[Crosscutting Concepts]

image::08-concepts-overview.png[width=640,height=200,float="center"]

Principal regulations and solution approach relevant in multiple parts of the system.

- domain models, architecture patterns and design patterns
- rules for using specific technology, technical consequences of overall decisions
- implementation rules

[.notes]
--
Concepts form the basis for conceptual integrity (consistency, homogeneity) of the architecture.
- concept papers with any kind of structure - cross-cutting model excerpts or scenarios using notations of the architecture views - example implementations,especially for technical concepts - reference to typical usage of standard frameworks (e.g. using Hibernate for object/relational mapping)
--

=== 8 - Tips

image::08-crosscutting-concepts.png[width=1260,height=600,float="center"]

== 9 - https://docs.arc42.org/section-9/[Architecture Decisions]

image::09-decision-overview.png[width=640,height=200,float="center"]

Important, expensive, critical, large scale or risky architecture decisions including rationales.

Use the {ref-adr} approach to document such decisions.

[.notes]
--
- Stakeholders and the development team of your system should be able to comprehend and retrace your decisions.
- Document decision criteria and rejected alternatives.
--

=== 9 - Architecture Decision Record

image::09-adr-details.png[width=260,height=260,role=right]

Smaller pieces of documentation are easier to read, create and maintain.
When it comes to architecture decisions, development teams often will:

- Know about the decision, as it is visible in the source code
- Miss the motivations behind that historical decision

[.notes]
--
Motivations for decisions change over time.
ADR record these motivations to empower teams to change decisions due to changes, e.g., technical evolutions.
--

== 10 - https://docs.arc42.org/section-10/[Quality]

image::10-q-scenario-overview.png[width=640,height=200,float="center"]

Quality requirements as scenarios.
The quality goals can be taken from section 1  _Introduction and goals_.

[.notes]
--
- Do not use ATAM because it is a slow and manual process.
- Evaluate fitness functions and continuous delivery as an approach to define and validate quality goals.
--

=== 10 - Tips

- Explore fitness functions
- Use static code analysis
- Write automated unit and acceptance tests
- Install monitoring
- Promote defect-driven development

[.notes]
--
Explore approaches:

- defect-driven development
- https://blog.tangly.net/blog/2020/advocate-zero-bug-policy-in-your-projects/[Advocate Zero Bug Policy]
--

== 11 - https://docs.arc42.org/section-11/[Risks and technical Debt]

image::11-risk-overview.png[width=640,height=200,float="center"]

The known technical risks or already present technical debt.

What potential problems exist in the application itself or its surroundings?

What does the development team fear for the future?

=== 11 - Tips

[quote,Tim Lister,Atlantics]
____
Risk management is project management for grown-ups.
____

Each risk has a description, an associated cost, a probability, and a set of mitigation measures.

== 12 - https://docs.arc42.org/section-12/[Glossary]

image::12-glossary-overview.png[width=640,height=200,float="center"]

Important domain and technical terms that stakeholders use when discussing the system.

Translate in other languages if there are multiple languages spoken in your company.

[.notes]
--
If possible, document everything in international English.
The ubiquitous language should also be English.
