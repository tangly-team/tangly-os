== Git Fluency

- {ref-git} is the de facto standard for source management
- Support agile and modern software engineering practices
- Preferred solution for all major digital product development platforms

[.notes]
--
- Agile approaches require incremental and iterative development solutions.
- You should use {ref-git} as your source code management system.
{ref-svn} is obsolete.
Updates are published at most once a year.
The last functional update is _1.14_ and was released in May 2020.

{ref-cvs} was the predecessor of {ref-svn} and should certainly not be used.
