=== Scrum in 100 Words

- Scrum is an *agile process* that allows us to focus on delivering the *highest business value* in the *shortest time*.
- It allows us to rapidly and repeatedly *inspect* actual working software (every two weeks or each day).
- The business sets the *priorities*.
Teams self-organize to determine *the best way to deliver the highest priority features*.
- At least every two weeks anyone can see real *working software* and decide to release it as is or continue to enhance it for another sprint.

=== Scrum Pillars

[.center-text]
Transparency - Inspection - Adaptation

- Scrum is founded on *empiricism* and *lean thinking*.
- Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes from experience and *making decisions based on what is observed*.
- Lean thinking reduces *waste* and focuses on the essentials.
