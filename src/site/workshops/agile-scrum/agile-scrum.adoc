== Why Agile?

[.notes]
--
Why should an organization embrace agile approaches to develop new digital products?
Is it just a management fad or is there a real benefit?
--

[.lightbg,background-opacity="0.4"]
=== Agile Organizations

image::agile-organizations.png[background,size=cover]

- Customer centric
- Small teams of professionals
- Networked transparent communication

[.notes]
--
Customer-centric means all collaborators can communicate directly with customers.

Professionals have a degree in software engineering and regularly attend trainings.
I want to see a certificate, an open-source project, a blog, or an Internet trace.

Transparent communication in networks allows any collaborator to communicate with another employee.

=== Roles and Responsibilities

image::roles-management.png[]

[.notes]
--
Value streams are another approach to creating a product-focused organization.

=== Agile Impact on Success

[.streched]
image::project-success-rates.png[]

[.notes]
--
The project using waterfall approach has almost a *three times* higher risk to utterly fail than a project using an agile approach.
--

=== Agile Manifesto

- *Individuals* and *interactions* over processes and tools
- *Working software* over comprehensive documentation
- *Customer collaboration* over contract negotiation
- *Responding to change* over following a plan

[.notes]
--
The right part is still relevant, but the emphasis is shifted to the left part of each statement.
--

=== Agile Manifesto Principles

[.streched]
image::agile-manifesto-principles.png[]

[.notes]
--
Feel free to tailor your agile approach to how you develop digital products.

The twelve principles are a good compass for the true North of agility.

=== Scrum Rules the World

[.streched]
image::scrum-rules-the-world.png[]

[.notes]
--
More than 75% of agile initiatives and digital product developments use a variant of Scrum.
--

== Scrum Principles

=== Scrum in 100 Words

- Scrum is an *agile process* that allows us to focus on delivering the *highest business value* in the *shortest time*.
- It allows us to rapidly and repeatedly *inspect* actual working software.
- The business sets the *priorities*.
Teams self-organize to determine *the best way to deliver the highest priority features*.
- At least every two weeks anyone can see *working software* and decide to release it or not.

[.notes]
--
The {ref-scrumguide} is the seminal text describing Scrum approach.

The two major Scrum organizations are {ref-scrum-alliance} and {ref-scrum-org}.
--

=== Scrum Pillars

[.center-text]
_Transparency - Inspection - Adaptation_

- Scrum is founded on *empiricism* and *lean thinking*.
- Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes from experience and *making decisions based on what is observed*.
- Lean thinking reduces *waste* and focuses on the essentials.

[.notes]
--
{ref-pdca} _PDCA_ is a key approach for empiricism and adaptation.
--

=== Scrum Values

image::scrum-values.png[background,size=cover]

[.notes]
--

Scrum Team members respect each other to be capable, independent people, and are respected as such by the people with whom they work.
The Scrum Team members have the courage to do the right thing, to work on tough problems.

--

== Scrum

=== Scrum Workflow

[.streched]
image::scrum-flow.png[]

[.notes]
--
The Scrum workflow contains multiple PDCA loops.
The team learns fast and early.
Experiments have low costs and accelerate learning.
--

== Scrum Events

[.streched]
image::scrum-approach.png[]

=== Sprint

- No changes are made that would endanger the *Sprint Goal*.
- *Quality does not decrease*.
- The Product Backlog is *refined* as needed.
- Scope may be clarified and renegotiated with the Product Owner as more is learned

[.notes]
--
Most Scrum teams have sprints with a two-week duration.

Efficient teams release an increment multiple times during a sprint.
--

=== Sprint Planning

image:sprint-planning.png[]

=== Sprint Planning Questions

- *Why* is the Sprint valuable?
- *What* can be done in this Sprint?
- *How* will the chosen work get done?

[.notes]
--
The sprint goal is essential to avoid becoming a story factory.

Just realizing a bunch of product backlog items does not mean the increment has value!
--

=== Daily Scrum

image:daily-scrum.png[]

[.notes]
--
Can we realize the Sprint goal or shall we take corrective measures?

This is the purpose of the daily Scrum.

This meeting shall be held daily to timely react to discovered problems and impediments.
--

=== Sprint Review

image:sprint-review.png[]

[.notes]
--
A sprint review is •not* a demonstration.
You demonstrate the increment and discuss the findings of the Sprint.

If the last sprint reviews never had an impact on the product backlog, you are doing it wrong!
--

=== Retrospective

image::sprint-retrospective.png[]

[.notes]
--
At least one improvement measure is identified in a good retrospective.

This measure is a product backlog item and is planned as a high-priority task for the next Sprint.
--

=== _Product Backlog Refinement_

image:product-backlog-refinement.png[]

[.notes]
--
The whole team understands the next product backlog items _PBI_ and why they have value.

The developers have an idea how these functions could be realized.
--

=== _Architecture and Design_

- Hold architecture workshops
- Hold coding dojos at the end of the Sprint
- Encourage team working including pair or mob programming
- Document design and decisions for future team members
- Extend the _Definition of Done_

[.notes]
--
Remember the {ref-manifesto-principles}.

- Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
- The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
- Simplicity _the art of maximizing the amount of work not done_ is essential.
See {ref-yagni}.
--

=== _Other Meetings_

- You need conversations with stakeholders and users to fulfill the *product goal*.
- All other meetings are a waste of time! +
_Progress meetings, status meetings, and steering committees are a waste of time and money_.

[.notes]
--
Your job is to create an awesome product.
Your job is never to attend meetings to satisfy the curiosity of others or your own organization.
--

== Scrum Roles

[.streched]
image::scrum-approach.png[]

=== Developers

image:development-team.png[]

[.notes]
--
A team is cross-functional and has all capabilities to create the product.

All developers have the same title.
Meritocracy is key for a high-performing team.

Developers are often T-shaped.
Expert in one domain, knowledgeable in other areas.
--

=== Developers Responsibilities

- Create a plan for the Sprint and the Sprint Backlog
- Instill quality by adhering to the _Definition of Done_
- Adapt their plan each day toward the _Sprint Goal_
- Hold each other accountable as professionals

[.notes]
--
Beware that no all engineers like to be accountable.
--

=== Product Owner

image:product-owner.jpg[]

=== Product Owner Responsibilities

- Develop and explicitly communicate the Product Goal
- Create and clearly communicate Product Backlog items
- Order Product Backlog items _PBI_
- Ensure that the Product Backlog is transparent, visible and understood

=== Scrum Master

image:scrum-master.png[]

=== Support Scrum Team (1/3)

- Coach the team members in self-management and cross-functionality
- Help the Scrum Team focus on creating high-value Increments that meet the Definition of Done
- Cause the removal of impediments to the Scrum Team’s progress
- Ensure that all Scrum events take place and are positive, productive, and kept within the timebox

=== Support Product Owner (2/3)

- Help find techniques for effective Product Goal definition and Product Backlog management
- Help the Scrum Team understand the need for clear and concise Product Backlog items
- Help establish empirical product planning for a complex environment
- Facilitate stakeholder collaboration as requested or needed

=== Support Organization (3/3)

- Lead, train, and coach the organization in its Scrum adoption
- Plan and advise Scrum implementations within the organization
- Help employees and stakeholders understand and enact an empirical approach for complex work
- Remove barriers between stakeholders and Scrum Teams

== Scrum Artifacts

[.streched]
image::scrum-approach.png[]

[.notes]
--
Each artifact contains a commitment to ensure it provides information that enhances transparency and focus against which progress can be measured:

- For the Product Backlog, it is the _Product Goal_.
- For the Sprint Backlog, it is the _Sprint Goal_.
- For the Increment, it is the _Definition of Done_.
--

=== Product Backlog

image:product-backlog.png[]

=== Sprint Backlog

image:sprint-backlog.png[]

[.notes]
--
A successful agile team has work in progress _WIP_ constraints.

A product backlog item _PBI_ is either not started, working, or completed.
This means that a _PBI_ is either 0% or 100% completed.
Other values have no relevance.

Agile developers know you have either fix milestones and variable functionally, and fix functionality and variable milestones.
--

=== Product Increment

image:product-increment.png[]

[.notes]
--
A product is a vehicle to deliver value.
It has a clear boundary, known stakeholders, well-defined users or customers.
A product could be a service, a physical product, or something more abstract.
--

=== Scrum Commitments

image::scrum-commitments.jpg[]

[.notes]
--
Each artifact contains a commitment to ensure it provides information that enhances transparency and focus against which progress can be measured:

- For the Product Backlog, it is the _Product Goal_.
- For the Sprint Backlog, it is the _Sprint Goal_.
- For the Increment, it is the _Definition of Done_.

These commitments exist to reinforce empiricism and the Scrum values for the Scrum Team and their stakeholders.
--

== How to be Successful?

=== Agile Fluency

[.streched]
image::agile-fluency-model.png[]

=== Technical Agile Fluency

- Clean code and refactoring
- Version control
- Continuous integration and delivery
- Automated test suite, see TDD, ATDD, BDD
- Configuration and documentation as code

=== Software Craftsmanship

[.streched]
image::software-craftsmanship.png[]

=== DevOps

image:devops-lifecycle.jpg[]

=== Metrics

image:dora-metrics.jpg[]]

[.notes]
--
Empiricism is key for agile approaches and is a pilar of Scrum.

Choose your metrics.
A basic set of metrics could be the DORA metrics.
These metrics are not the only ones, but they are a good starting point.
They are kind standard in the DevOps community.

. Frequency of deployments
. The amount of time between acceptance and deployment
. How frequently deployments fail
. How long it takes to restore service—or recover from a failure
--

=== Team Dynamics

image::team-responsibilities.png[]

=== Think Lean and Agile

- A *team* works on a *product*.
Avoid story factories.
- Deliver *often*.
Collect *feedback*.
- Exhaustive requirements document at the beginning of the project is a fallacy.
Requirements are continuously refined.
- Detailed planning for the next year and tracking in hours are pointless.
