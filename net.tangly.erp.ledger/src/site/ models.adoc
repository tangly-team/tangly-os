== Bounded Domain Invoice Model

=== Concepts

Invoices define a business bounded domain as defined in domain driven design approach.
They are not constrained through external entities such as products, contracts or legal entities.
External entities can provide hints to streamline the creation of regular invoices.
The invoice article identifier is available as an external identifier to the article bounded domain.
Similar identifiers are available for legal entities.

VAT rates are defined within a article definition.
Therefore, different VAT rates require different article definitions.
For example in Switzerland a service company has two VAT rates.
One for regular services and one for services exempted from VAT taxes.

The currency is defined at the invoice level meaning all invoice items and subtotals should use the same currency.

=== Archiving

An invoice contains all the information to create a legally binding document and hove no dependencies to external systems.
Invoices should have a unique identifier for accounting purposes.
A good practice is to use the identifier as part of the archived file to streamline traceability.
Invoices can be stored in a database, exported as a PDF file or as a JSON file.
The PDF file is human readable and adequate for document archiving and legal auditing.
The JSON file is an adequate archive format which can digitally be processed.

package net.tangly.bus.crmRealm {
    class LegalEntity {}

    class BankConnection << (R,orchid) >> {
        String iban
        String bic
        String institute
    }

    class Contract {}
}

package net.tangly.bus.invoices {
class Product << (R,orchid) >> {
    String productId
    String description
    BigDecimal unitPrice
    String unit
    BigDecimal vatRate
}

class Invoice {
    String id
    String contractId
    LocalDate deliveryDate
    LocalDate invoicedDate
    LocalDate dueDate
    Currency currency
    String text
    String paymentConditions
}

note right: contractId is the identifier to\nthe contract instance in the CRM package

Invoice *-- InvoiceLine : lines
Invoice o--> LegalEntity : invoicingEntity
Invoice o--> LegalEntity : invoicedEntity
Invoice *--> BankConnection : invoicingConnection

interface InvoiceLine {}

class InvoiceItem << (R,orchid) >> {}

InvoiceLine <|.. InvoiceItem

InvoiceItem o-- Product : article

class Subtotal << (R,orchid) >> {}

InvoiceLine <|.. Subtotal
Subtotal o-- InvoiceLine

}
