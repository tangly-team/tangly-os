<p>The bounded domain <em>ledger</em> abstracts the accounting activities of a digital product company.</p>
<dl>
    <dt>Account</dt>
    <dd>Defines an account as seen for double entry booking ledger and legal accounting for tax ports.
        The account groups are assets, liabilities, expenses, or profits and losses.
        The account kinds are asset, liability, income, expense, or an aggregate one. The kind is used for computing correctly the balance.
        For example, an account with identifier <em>1</em>, of kind <em>ASSET</em>, and with a description <em>Assets</em>
        Aggregates are used to provide aggregated values such as E6, E5, etc.

    <dt>Transaction</dt>
    <dd>A simple transaction is a money transfer between a debit and a credit account.
        A split transaction is a money transfer between a debit account and a set of credit accounts or a credit account and a set of debit accounts. The
        total debit and the total credit of a transaction must be the same format.
        The majority of transactions have one debit and one credit account. The class is immutable.
        <p>Two kinds of transactions are supported. The simple transaction is a transfer from one debit account to a credit account. All information is
            stored at the transaction level. The split transaction is a transfer from one debit account to multiple credit accounts or from one credit
            account to multiple debit accounts.
            General information is stored on the transaction level, and specific data is stored in the associated split accounts.</p>
        <p>A transaction is an event in the ledger domain. The whole sequence of transactions fully describes the state of the ledger and all accounts
            defined inside.</p>
        <p> A transaction can have a VAT code. The code is either on the debit or the credit account. If the transaction is split, the VAT code can optionally
            be defined on multiple split positions. In this case the debit or credit account should not have a VAT code.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>Account Entry</dt>
    <dd>The account entry models one booking in an account of a double entry accounting system. See also transactions.</dd>

<p>The ledger structure is defined in the account instances.
    The ledger can be defined in a TSV file and imported in the system.
    The format and conventions of the ledger configuration file follow the ones of the <a href="https://www.banana.ch/">banana Accounting</a>.</p>

<h3>Invoices Reconciliation</h3>
<p>The transactions of paid invoices are reconciled with the invoices.
The reconciliation is done through the transaction reference, which should be the invoice identifier.
The process is successful if the referenced invoice was found and the invoice amount is the same as the transaction amount.</p>
<p>Analytical data is also provided:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Is the transaction successfully reconciled?</li>
    <li>What is the difference between the invoice and the transaction amount?</li>
    <li>How many days lay between the invoice due date and the transaction booking date?</li>
</ul>
