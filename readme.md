## Compile the product

You shall have access to a https://git-scm.com/[Git] installation to clone the repository and download the files.
You must install https://openjdk.java.net/install/index.html[JDK] version 15 to compile the source code.
The https://gradle.org/[Gradle] build file can be triggered without any supplemental installation with

````shell
./gradlew build
````

The first run will take time because all dependencies will be downloaded from Maven repositories.
The next compilations will be much faster.
Ensure you have enough bandwidth to provide a smooth experience.

All development activities are performed with probably the best Java IDE IntelliJ IDEA.
