/**
 * Provides core abstractions used in any commercial application in need of invoice handling. The defined information forms the basis to create an output
 * invoice legible for human beings and fulfilling the European requirements for a legal invoice document.
 * <h2>Abstractions</h2>
 * <p>The invoices package is designed as a bounded domain.</p>
 * <p>Articles define the items being sold and are referred in invoice lines.</p>
 * <h2>Invoices</h2>
 * <h3> Definition</h3>
 * <p>An invoice, bill or tab is a commercial document issued by a seller to a buyer, relating to a sale transaction and indicating the products, quantities,
 * and agreed prices for products or services the seller had provided the buyer.</p>
 * <p>Payment terms are usually stated on the invoice. These may specify that the buyer has a maximum number of days in which to pay and is sometimes offered a
 * discount if paid before the due date. The buyer could have already paid for the products or services listed on the invoice. To avoid confusion, and
 * consequent unnecessary communications from buyer to seller, some sellers clearly state in large and/or capital letters on an invoice whether it has already
 * been paid.</p>
 * <p> From the point of view of a seller, an invoice is a sales invoice. From the point of view of a buyer, an invoice is a purchase invoice. The document
 * indicates the buyer and seller, but the term invoice indicates money is owed or owing.</p>
 * <p>Within the European union, an invoice is primarily legally defined by the EU VAT directive as an accounting voucher (to verify tax and VAT reporting) and
 * secondly as a Civil law (common law) document.</p>
 * <h3>Implementation</h3>
 * <p>An invoice instance shall fully define the content of legally binding invoice. The provided information allows the sending of an invoice either per
 * post mail or per electronic mail. Digital features such as SwissQR code or European FacturX digital invoice can be created with the invoice data.</p>
 * <p>Invoice instances are archived as a JSON document. Such a document can be stored on a file system or in a database.</p>
